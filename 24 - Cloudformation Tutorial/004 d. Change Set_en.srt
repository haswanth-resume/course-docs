1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,630
In this video, we're going to see about change set.

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,860
One of the most important thing I feel for life or production systems.

3
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,010
When you have a stack life up and running and you want to make change, you really need to see what

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,050
this change is going to or how this change is going to affect your existing resources.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,520
So we'll create an easy to instance and then we're going to make some changes to it and we'll see from

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:27,290
the change set how does it affect.

7
00:00:27,650 --> 00:00:31,550
So it's create a new file save we'll call it as.

8
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,640
Change hyphen set.

9
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:36,520
Dot y wireman.

10
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:42,750
So I'll just copy the previous resource.

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:51,420
Okay, First we'll just create instance with this template and then we'll make changes to it.

12
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:55,280
And it creates Jack.

13
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,880
Tablet is ready.

14
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,130
Upload our template.

15
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,030
Chin said.

16
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:06,620
And we'll see next.

17
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:14,600
Brexit testing Change set.

18
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,550
Now when you creating it first time change, it doesn't make sense.

19
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:23,010
There's not going to be any much change.

20
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,110
It's a fresh stack, but you can still see create change set.

21
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:29,940
But first, we'll create the stack.

22
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:31,410
Then we'll make the change.

23
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,730
Let's wait for a moment so it becomes stable.

24
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:37,080
Okay, Create.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,920
Completed.

26
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:40,470
Now let's update the template.

27
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:42,950
And upload it again.

28
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,400
So first I will just change a tag.

29
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:46,010
I will.

30
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,920
Change from name this to.

31
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:58,210
Does it change one?

32
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,330
See this?

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:04,540
And let's update our template.

34
00:02:04,870 --> 00:02:12,270
Update replace or should I say use current template replace will upload it back once again.

35
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,830
Upload template choose file.

36
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,460
Same template, but there are differences now.

37
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,610
And let's go next.

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,300
Her next.

39
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,380
Next.

40
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,370
Okay here.

41
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:30,990
It's going to wait for a moment.

42
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:35,580
So it's really checking there.

43
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,450
So it's comparing your template with the existing resource.

44
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:43,140
And it found there is the action is going to be modify.

45
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,200
You can see a view change set to see it in detail changes.

46
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,960
So there will be a modify.

47
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,970
So this is fine.

48
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,670
It's going to be modifying it input.

49
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:58,050
We are not really providing any input like parameters or anything.

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,360
Templates, you can see the templates.

51
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,880
Jay are the Jason changes.

52
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,440
Okay.

53
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,680
This should be fine.

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,770
If you're good with this, you will say execute.

55
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,390
Okay, so the update completed and it has modified it.

56
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,820
Let's make one more try.

57
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,910
You can test that with also instance type.

58
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,280
When you check with instance type, it's going to shut down your instance and then bring it back.

59
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,020
Too small.

60
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,430
Let's see if this.

61
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,680
And let's go back.

62
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,490
Update.

63
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:41,960
Replace upload.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:46,000
So I made a change to the instance type.

65
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,760
You really don't need to do this because this is chargeable.

66
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,560
It's not due to micro.

67
00:03:53,230 --> 00:03:57,070
But I'm just going to run it for less than an hour.

68
00:03:57,730 --> 00:04:00,160
So that should be fine.

69
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,040
Still it modified.

70
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,170
We'll change that.

71
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,060
So there's really modification camp.

72
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:12,000
If you're good with this, then you can say execute or you can say delete.

73
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,220
I would like to delete this change set.

74
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:15,170
All right.

75
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:17,190
So I don't want to make any changes.

76
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:19,200
I'm good with the existing thing.

77
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:23,060
Okay, let's try to do something more.

78
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,820
I will change the Ahmed.

79
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,620
Now, that's not possible, right?

80
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,080
How can you change an image of an instance?

81
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:30,500
Right.

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,670
It's going to delete it.

83
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,430
But maybe you did it by mistake, right?

84
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:41,150
Or you meant to make some change, and you didn't think thoroughly about it.

85
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,040
That it's an immutable change.

86
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,570
Like changing an army.

87
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,570
Is not possible, Right?

88
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,840
So we know very easy, for instance, very well.

89
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:51,800
So we know about that.

90
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,020
But things like sometimes, you know, we using some service like ideas or elastic cache or active amp

91
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:03,200
or any any such service where we make some change and that may result in the data loss.

92
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:07,400
So change that will help we will be will be very helpful in such cases.

93
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,160
So let's try this.

94
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:17,600
Update replace upload template new template.

95
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,120
Now this template contains the new image ID.

96
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,470
Let's see what happens.

97
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,060
Next.

98
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:29,930
Okay.

99
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,290
Let's see.

100
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:37,370
Okay, it says modify, but if you see here replacement true.

101
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:39,050
Okay.

102
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,040
That means it's going to definitely delete it and recreate it.

103
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,550
And so you need to be checking here.

104
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,690
All right.

105
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:51,480
Okay.

106
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,200
If you're good with this, you can execute or you can delete.

107
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,790
I'm not good with this.

108
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:58,040
I don't want to terminate replace my instance.

109
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,990
Maybe that will cause me data loss.

110
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:02,000
So I'll say delete this change.

111
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,140
Like this.

112
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,440
This change set can help you and save from big disasters.

113
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:14,230
All right, If you're done here, just delete your stack and join me in the next video.
