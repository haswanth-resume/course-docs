1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:09,060
So far we have seen just one section in our template anatomy, but we have other sections like mapping.

2
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:11,700
In this video we'll be talking about mapping.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,170
We'll take an example for that and we'll also see some new pseudo parameters.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,150
So let's go to working with templates.

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,070
Template Anatomy.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,510
And mappings.

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:25,530
Let's click on that.

8
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:32,700
Now what is mapping is just like a dictionary and you want to fetch some value.

9
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:37,110
You have to give the key name and you can create multiple levels inside.

10
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:45,080
And once you declare a mapping variable, you can use a finding map intrinsic function to find values

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,250
from your keys.

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,410
So example should make more sense.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,990
So let's scroll down, let's see examples.

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,300
So that's the section mappings.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,180
Like we have resources, we have also mapping section.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:58,810
Inside that you give a name.

17
00:00:59,080 --> 00:01:00,850
This is mapping for am-I.

18
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:07,420
So we are saying for this region, if you're doing it in this region, you can say finding map function

19
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:12,040
for this particular region and it's going to return the value, which is this.

20
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:17,060
Mapping is mostly used for this particular example, Amis.

21
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:22,370
As we have seen so far, we're jumping between regions and we are getting a problem of having different,

22
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:23,960
different army IDs.

23
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:30,350
So if you want a cloud formation template for UDC to instance, to be working on every region without

24
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:36,590
making any changes, then you can use mapping to store the image IDs.

25
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,500
So let's create a new template now.

26
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,120
We'll call it as mappings.

27
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:50,590
And also we're going to do some pseudo parameters.

28
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,680
Dot y.

29
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,990
M.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,450
L.

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:00,200
So let's copy the mappings.

32
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,360
I'll make some changes.

33
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:17,970
I will give this name as a my region map and I will keep these regions and to this I will change it

34
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,470
to EMI.

35
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,360
Okay.

36
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:29,060
Now I'm going to go to these regions and find the idea of Amazon Linux to.

37
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:32,000
I'm in US East one.

38
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,450
I will get Amazon Linux from ID from here.

39
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:39,670
Let me put that over here.

40
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,840
I will also have it for us.

41
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,990
Easter to us East.

42
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,610
To.

43
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,110
To go to us is to.

44
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,240
That's convenient.

45
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,110
US West one.

46
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,650
So we don't have us.

47
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,020
West one Let's put here the US.

48
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,460
West one.

49
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,440
And I'm going to stop here.

50
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:30,940
I'll remove these things.

51
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:37,460
If you're going to use more region, then mention all the region and the image ID that you're going

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,930
to use from that region.

53
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,570
For now, I'll only keep this much.

54
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,660
Next, the easy to instance.

55
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,660
So we have to give that in the resources.

56
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:51,410
Okay, let's take that from the previous example.

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:56,520
Here.

58
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,720
The image is hard coded.

59
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,910
Now I'm going to refer from here my Amy from the mappings.

60
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,520
And for that I have to use the function.

61
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:12,020
Find in map.

62
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,500
And we have to pass three values for this.

63
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,149
We have to pass the name of the mapping.

64
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:22,120
We have to pass the key from that mapping.

65
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:25,900
What we are referring to in that the sub key of it.

66
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,890
It should give you the right, Amy.

67
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,240
So how do I do?

68
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,990
Now you can do it in this format.

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,750
You can pass all the argument in a list format.

70
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,690
So I'm going to say my region map the name.

71
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:46,530
First I have to pass, then then the key inside that, which is actually a region name.

72
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,260
But then I have to hardcoded, right.

73
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,120
Instead of that I can use.

74
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,650
Pseudo parameter E.

75
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,910
S colon, colon region.

76
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:04,370
So wherever I create this template, it will have the region code, right?

77
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,720
And instead of giving hard coding it, it will automatically pick up the region name.

78
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,820
And from that region name, I would like to give the next key, which is my basically.

79
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:19,370
So based on the region that I create, it's going to go to that key.

80
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,670
And then inside that AMI the sub key of it and it's going to pick up the my ID, the rest of it, I'll

81
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:29,180
create save our security group going to do the security group as well.

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,420
So security group here.

83
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:37,330
Can will copy it from the previous.

84
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,710
Template.

85
00:05:45,510 --> 00:05:47,430
Care to take care of the indentation?

86
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,880
And yeah, all the logical IDs are in the same line.

87
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,400
Okay, this seems good.

88
00:05:55,410 --> 00:05:56,640
Let's save this.

89
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:05,440
And I'm going to create my cloud formation template from or my stack from any of the three region.

90
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:07,510
So let's go.

91
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:18,650
Okay, so I'm in Ohio region US East too, and we have created a mapping of RMI for this region.

92
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:29,240
And I will go to Ohio region or the instances.

93
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,800
Okay, Let's create the stack.

94
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:32,790
Create stack.

95
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,600
Upload template.

96
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,730
Choose file.

97
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,950
Mapping and pseudo.

98
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,010
Let's go next.

99
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,990
See mapping.

100
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:52,770
That's just a map example.

101
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,960
Next.

102
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,270
Next.

103
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,000
And create stack.

104
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:06,950
Okay, So it's creating the security group first, as usual.

105
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,110
Now it's creating the instance.

106
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,190
Okay, let's go to the instance.

107
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:15,600
Refresh.

108
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:16,600
Okay.

109
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:17,340
It's creating it.

110
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,970
So it found its image ID automatically from mappings.

111
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,020
I scroll down to see my ID.

112
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:32,810
So that's the last 7912 in US history to us is to yes, you see that.

113
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:39,200
So finding map has found the right ID for us based on our region.

114
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:40,070
Region.

115
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:45,080
Also we are selecting automatically based on where the template is getting, where the stack is getting

116
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:45,830
created.

117
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,720
If you're only curious to log in to an instance that are getting launched, we're going to do that in

118
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,580
the next video where we'll select the key payer.

119
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,140
We're going to see what are parameters, how to use them.

120
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:05,410
And for an example, we're going to take key pair and also instance type as the input parameter from

121
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:06,220
the user.

122
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,190
If you're done here, you can delete the stack.

123
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:15,310
And you can join me in the next video.
