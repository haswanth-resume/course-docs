1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,990
So we have seen join intrinsic function previously.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:08,810
In this video, we're going to see an intrinsic function ref.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:11,430
As the name suggests.

4
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:17,900
Ref It refers something like you create a security group and then you want to refer that security group

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:19,820
while you're creating to instance.

6
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:25,700
So you want to refer an existing resource or a parameter while you're creating or making change to your

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,630
existing resource.

8
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,400
Then you can use a ref function.

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,510
Some examples.

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,230
Let's see.

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,950
So this is an example creating an elastic IP.

12
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:42,460
So logical ID is my IP here type easy to elastic IP properties.

13
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,290
So we want to here join this elastic or associate elastic IP.

14
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:54,540
Do an instance that you already have created, or we mentioned it in the same template.

15
00:00:54,540 --> 00:01:01,890
So we can say Ref, we call this function and we give the logical ID of the resource.

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,890
We're going to do such kind of things in the next video.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:09,300
In this video we'll see a very simple example of ref intrinsic function.

18
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,840
So I'll create a new file.

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:25,700
I've been named as a ref hyphen function dot AML.

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:31,400
I will use this.

21
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,210
So there's one function already, one interesting function.

22
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:45,700
Join over here and you can pass an argument like this in square bracket, but you can also pass in vertically

23
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,350
a proper YAML format.

24
00:01:50,420 --> 00:01:51,680
John, delete this.

25
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,300
So first argument that I'm going to pass to Ref is join with the space.

26
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,560
And the next argument is a list.

27
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,030
Again, more arguments.

28
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,130
So I will join.

29
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:15,500
My v profile or my just instance in.

30
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:23,900
And here I will use the function.

31
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:27,770
So I don't have any other existing logical ID in this template.

32
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:32,600
So I'm going to use this plus colon.

33
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,260
Colon.

34
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,030
Region.

35
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:41,640
So as in this template, I don't have any other logical idea to refer.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,240
So I'm referring an existing parameter.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,780
This is a pseudo parameter.

38
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,910
You have some list of pseudo parameters.

39
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,610
Like account ID notification.

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:52,460
An.

41
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,740
No value.

42
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,400
Partition region.

43
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:05,240
So wherever this template will get executed, where the stack will get created so that region value

44
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,200
will be returned.

45
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,400
There are a few others.

46
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,950
Stack id stack name u.

47
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:10,070
R.

48
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:10,940
L suffix.

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,050
Okay, let's go ahead.

50
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,040
See if this.

51
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,950
And let's create a cloud formation stack.

52
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:21,110
I'm doing it in Mumbai region.

53
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:23,180
Let's create stack.

54
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,230
Upload my template.

55
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,530
The rare function.

56
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:33,930
Go next.

57
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,910
Let's wait for a moment.

58
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,220
And there is a failure rollback.

59
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,950
So if the template creation if the stack creation fails.

60
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:06,250
It will roll back your changes automatically.

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,190
You can see the error.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,770
It says Wrong army ID This army does not exist.

63
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:13,570
This army is from.

64
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:19,490
Oregon region and of course in Mumbai region, the Ahmed will be different.

65
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:20,750
So let's find.

66
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:22,880
And why I'd.

67
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,410
Let's copy that.

68
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,750
Let's update that in our template.

69
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:31,820
Save it.

70
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,620
Let's go back.

71
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,260
So a rollback is completed.

72
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,910
But you should still see this tag.

73
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,690
It should have not created any resource.

74
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,730
So I'm going to delete this tag.

75
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:51,450
Stacks gone.

76
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,430
Let's create a new stack.

77
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,920
Let's wait for a moment.

78
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:25,970
Yes, it is.

79
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:26,800
Create complete.

80
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:28,610
Let's check our instance.

81
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,840
The Mumbai region and its name and you see there.

82
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:39,320
So we are referring to a parameter pseudo parameter.

83
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,510
So it automatically got the region ID there.

84
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,440
In next example where we also going to create security group.

85
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:55,860
We'll see how we can refer like this security group for an easy to instance.

86
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,560
So if you're done here, delete your stack.

87
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,810
And join me in the next video.
