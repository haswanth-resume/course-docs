00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:06,480
In this video, we're going to see how to create a security group and easy, for instance, from the

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,890
same template file.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,620
We're talking about multiple resources.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:14,640
If you have multiple resources, we also may need to refer them.

5
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:19,290
Like if you're creating security group, I want to refer it into my e C, for instance.

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:25,800
First, we'll see how to create a security group so you can check in the documentation template, reference

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,770
resources and property reference.

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,770
You can find your resource.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:35,170
Let's go to AC to security group is part of AC two.

10
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:40,760
There you have AC two and you have a lot of properties in easy to.

11
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:43,150
Let's expand this a little bit.

12
00:00:43,330 --> 00:00:45,040
Let's find security group.

13
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:48,030
The security group.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:50,490
You can click on it.

15
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:52,890
And you can reduce this.

16
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,880
And as I generally do, just I just go to the example so you can go to the example JSON or YAML.

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:03,630
We're going YAML so they're not.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,950
And this is an easy copy button also there, so you can copy if you want.

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,030
But I'll do that later.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,620
First, I will create a file.

21
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,210
I'm going to call it as multi resource dot y html.

22
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,760
So if you generally create easy, for instance from the console, you create easy to instance first.

23
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:35,140
And while you're creating easy, the instance you create or select your security group.

24
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:41,380
If you like that order, you can do the same order in the template.

25
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:47,080
Cloud formation is smart enough to understand how to order your resource.

26
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,150
So I will take a previous example from functions.

27
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,140
Let's take that.

28
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:58,240
So I'll keep it as it is.

29
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,570
And I'm going to give a property for security group.

30
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,419
Security groups give you multiple security group.

31
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:13,110
It's a list so you can give in hyphen and elements in the list.

32
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,880
So I want to refer.

33
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,030
And if you're thinking we have not yet created security group, that's fine.

34
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:19,840
We can create it after this.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:23,160
I mean, we can mention the security group after the instance.

36
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:26,190
The order here is not important.

37
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,290
So I'm going to say refer to.

38
00:02:29,570 --> 00:02:31,160
V profile.

39
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:38,420
SG which I have not yet created, but then I'll make sure I will give the same logical ID when I'm creating

40
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,440
the security group.

41
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:45,290
I will make sure I'm going to create it in the same line.

42
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:51,650
So I will give the same name as I've given over here.

43
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,500
The logical ID.

44
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,450
And the rest who make our life easy.

45
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:02,460
We can copy it directly from here.

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,290
I'm going to just copy it from there.

47
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,120
Till the end.

48
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,840
Take care of the indentation.

49
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,460
You see the properties going out.

50
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,720
So let's bring it in.

51
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:23,420
I will say allow I'll add to rule as such and HDP.

52
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,090
From my IP, I'll say that's a description.

53
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,990
Because I'm not mentioning VPC ID, that's not mandatory.

54
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:42,750
If you don't mention it's going to take the default VPC security group Ingress inbound rule Security

55
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,430
group egress, outbound rule.

56
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,460
Again, list of rules.

57
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,990
It's a hyphen IP protocol, TCP hat from anywhere.

58
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:50,970
That's fine.

59
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,300
I will also add one more rule.

60
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:58,740
I just copy this.

61
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:13,280
DHCP LC 2020 22 to 2 allowed from only my IP, my IP slash 30 slash 32.

62
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,300
Ingress and egress is not important.

63
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,320
If we don't give this, it's because this is 88 allowed from.

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,900
So, you know we won't be able to do such right.

65
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:26,630
We have to probably see then such rule also.

66
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:32,730
Anyways, I'm not giving outbound rule if you don't give it's going to all anyways have all traffic

67
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,980
can go anywhere.

68
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,580
Okay, let's save this and let's check again.

69
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,360
So instance will get created.

70
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,870
Ahmed, We need to take care of the Ahmed.

71
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,270
So I will check the Ahmed.

72
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,450
I will launch an instance.

73
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,200
And let's go with.

74
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,310
Open to this time.

75
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:59,550
Okay, So I'm going to create my cloud formation stack in Mumbai region.

76
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:01,890
So I'm fetching Ahmed from Mumbai region.

77
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:10,440
Okay, This is fine.

78
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,250
Save it.

79
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:14,470
And let's create our stack now.

80
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,440
Let's go to Cloud formation Stack and Mumbai region.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,880
Create stack.

82
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,710
Upload a template.

83
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,550
Multi resource.

84
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:24,630
That's the one.

85
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,290
You can see in designer.

86
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,310
Let's see how it looks in the designer.

87
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:36,050
You see that there's a V profile security group and there is an arrow which says really that it is referring

88
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,190
to the security group.

89
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,800
Let's validate our template.

90
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,960
Template is valid.

91
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,840
And let's create it.

92
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:48,910
Next.

93
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,360
That's entered our name.

94
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,520
I'll give multi resource.

95
00:05:58,770 --> 00:05:59,790
Now let's take everything.

96
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,630
Default.

97
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,200
Create stack.

98
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,150
Okay.

99
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:09,700
You see, the first thing it's doing, it's creating security group, right?

100
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,740
We have given it in a different order.

101
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:16,720
We give an easy to instance force and we're smart enough to understand that we need security group first

102
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,070
because it's referring it.

103
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:25,910
Let's go to our digital dashboard.

104
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:27,470
Let's go to security group.

105
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,050
And you should see the security group.

106
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:38,450
Inbound rule 80 allowed from anywhere, 22 allowed from my IP outbound rules we have not mentioned so

107
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:40,310
at any way sticks this default rule.

108
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:42,050
Okay.

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,730
Let's check out instance.

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,650
It should be having the same security group.

111
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,880
Yes, There.

112
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,620
Let's see the tags.

113
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,040
And that's a nametag, which is obviously it is showing there.

114
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,170
And the stack ID is well.

115
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:06,680
Okay, So this template was or this video was about a referring.

116
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,710
A logical ID in a multi resource template.

117
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:16,580
So we have multiple resources, we have incidents and we have the security group.

118
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,870
You also learn one more thing.

119
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,300
Order of creation will be handled by cloud formation.

120
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:28,130
We can specify it in any order, but sometimes there are chances that its order may go wrong and we

121
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,630
will get errors for that.

122
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:33,290
We can handle also that we'll see those things in project.

123
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:39,270
We'll see how we can create dependencies between resources for the order.

124
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,690
Okay, this creation is completed anyways.

125
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,830
We have verified everything.

126
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,030
We can delete it.

127
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:51,770
Delete stack.

128
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,340
Delete in progress.

129
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:00,420
So wrap up your stack over here and join me in the next video.
