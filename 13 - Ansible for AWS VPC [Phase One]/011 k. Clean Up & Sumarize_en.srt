1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,540
So that should be all in this project.

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:06,040
But wait, we have to do a little cleanup.

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:09,990
We have Nat Gateway Elastic IP and those things should be removed.

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,720
So let's go to our VPC section.

5
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:14,600
Nat Gateway.

6
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,360
If you'd like to keep this VPC, you can except delete the navigate and release the elastic IP.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,740
So that will take some time to delete the net gateway.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,600
Once the Nat Gateway is deleted, you make sure you go to elastic IP section.

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:38,930
And you have to say release elastic IP address.

10
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:44,090
But that's going to not be you know, that's not going to be working right now because it's already

11
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:46,220
attached to Nat Gateway and you'll get an error.

12
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,750
By the time you can delete your bastion.

13
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,380
Host.

14
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:01,750
If you also wish to terminate your instance, you can.

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:06,670
If you have the source code in our repository.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,310
So in our repository you can really access it from GitHub also.

17
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:17,260
So we have the branch Ansible hyphen VPC.

18
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:22,840
Check out this branch and you should see all the code that we have used in this project.

19
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,200
Use it as a reference.

20
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,930
It's better you write the code by yourself, step by step.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,710
Everything.

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,570
But still all the information is available.

23
00:01:31,570 --> 00:01:33,430
The VPC setup playbook is there.

24
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,000
The Bastion instance.

25
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:40,110
Variables.

26
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,090
And feel free to change the value of variables as per your wish.

27
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:51,320
As per your region, you want to use as per the zone that you want to use.

28
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:52,390
Okay.

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,770
So as we're talking, this Nat Gateway is also deleted.

30
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,760
And now I should be able to release the elastic IP or it takes still some time.

31
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,010
Yeah, it's done.

32
00:02:07,030 --> 00:02:08,229
If you're getting an error.

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,370
Elastic grip is already attached, so wait for a few minutes.

34
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,500
It will release the elastic IP from the nat Gateway and then you can release the elastic IP back to

35
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:23,010
the pool if you wish to keep other things like VPC subnets routable, you can keep that.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,810
And anyways, you have the code, you can launch NAT gateways and all the things whenever you want.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,370
All right then.

38
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:35,100
Then let's wrap up this project video with the architectural design that we have seen.

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:42,690
So we created the playbook which access the variables, and we have specified the list of modules.

40
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,090
It used Python bottle.

41
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,460
If you remember, we installed the bottle library.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:53,160
We make API connection to a cloud or account by using the IM roles.

43
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:54,570
We created the VPC.

44
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:57,270
In three zones we created.

45
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:59,040
In the diagram, you have just two zones.

46
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,100
Public subnet.

47
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,090
With internet gateway and round table connection.

48
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:13,500
We created private subnets with Nat Gateway and out table connection.

49
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,910
And of course, the Bastion host we also created Keep It and Security Group for the Bastion host And

50
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:23,670
then we launch the instance in the security group.

51
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,780
So that will be all in this project.

52
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:29,400
I hope you have learned a lot.

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,220
Thank you very much for watching this.

54
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:34,020
I will see you in the next one.
