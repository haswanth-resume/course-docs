1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:06,650
Okay, so now let's get started and started with our VPC playbook.

2
00:00:06,890 --> 00:00:08,690
So I'm going to say new.

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:14,370
And I'll just see file, just give an extension, that's all.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,700
So the playbook, I'm going to name it as VPC setup dot yaml.

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:20,960
Yeah.

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:24,000
You see, it's just see reading it there as why am I look.

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:25,940
So it's going to understand now yaml.

8
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:30,140
So for host on local host.

9
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:36,640
Connection and all this from our warmup exercises, Right.

10
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:38,350
Connection local.

11
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:40,680
Gather facts.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:43,050
False.

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:45,060
I don't want to get together any facts.

14
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:46,680
Tasks.

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,590
For Starsk, We're going to import our variables files because we're going to use that.

16
00:00:53,190 --> 00:01:00,720
So let's name that task and say import VPC variables.

17
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:03,060
Okay.

18
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,290
You see, I hit enter.

19
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:06,860
It automatically goes in the same line, Right?

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,570
So that's the benefit of it is.

21
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:18,390
So we're going to use include underscore versus module and we'll mention the path of our variables or

22
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,870
better.

23
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:21,300
I was thinking to put variables into a vast directory.

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:22,050
So you know what?

25
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,700
Let's create a directory here.

26
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,510
New directory, I will create a directory named as VARs.

27
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:33,710
In this directory.

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,480
We'll put our variables file.

29
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,230
Okay, let's move it.

30
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:40,660
Three factor.

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:44,960
Yeah.

32
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,790
This is much better, actually.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:48,840
So do that.

34
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:54,950
Or it doesn't matter if you keep it in the same level, but just convenience.

35
00:01:55,790 --> 00:01:57,230
And also good practice.

36
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:00,750
And whether you have mentioned just mentioned the path.

37
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:05,250
So I'm going to say I have put it into verse VPC, underscore a set up.

38
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,050
That's my variable file name.

39
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:09,360
Yeah.

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,290
Okay.

41
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,190
That's first thing.

42
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:14,400
Okay.

43
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:17,560
And I'm going to mention first task to create the VPC range.

44
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,840
Let's create the profile.

45
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,740
VPC.

46
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,950
The model we have is easy to underscore.

47
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,840
VPC.

48
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,200
Underscore net.

49
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,480
That's the module name.

50
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,400
And you have several options with that.

51
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:35,770
First, the name of the VPC.

52
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:43,210
And if you're going to access our variable, we have the variable, right?

53
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:48,700
VPC underscore name that will mention, yes, this is much better.

54
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,200
CIDR underscore block.

55
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,080
So let's access the variable name VPC CIDR.

56
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:04,690
Right.

57
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,380
Now, if you're not so much fan of using variables and you just mentioned that static value and you're

58
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,170
wondering why not directly give the names instead of giving the variables and then having it in extra

59
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,220
variable files?

60
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:24,230
Well, it's because so you can reuse when I'm going to give you the same code.

61
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:26,090
You'll understand the difference.

62
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,280
You don't need to edit the playbook.

63
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,410
You just need to change the variable value.

64
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,190
And that's it.

65
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,830
You're done.

66
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:32,900
You can execute your playbook.

67
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,730
So it makes the code reusable.

68
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:37,250
So you try to use variable as much as you can.

69
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,580
Region will mention.

70
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,260
So we have defined the variable as just region.

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:52,220
A few few other options that I learned which will need DNS support.

72
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:52,680
Yes.

73
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,610
DNS hostname.

74
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:53,970
Yes.

75
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:56,280
Tenancy default, state and present.

76
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,300
Anyways, the state is by default as present.

77
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:06,570
So this will create our VPC, but as from the warmup exercise, remember we have to store the output.

78
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,060
Right.

79
00:04:08,070 --> 00:04:10,860
We're going to use let's say variable called VPC out.

80
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:14,410
It's going to store the output of the execution.

81
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:21,670
If you have doubt in these options and the name of the playbook, just go to Ansible documentation.

82
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:25,560
Yeah.

83
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,780
Let's go back here.

84
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:28,190
Go back.

85
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,610
VPC underscore net configure a virtual private cloud.

86
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:36,530
So check in the documentation.

87
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,270
You have the dependencies, mentioned all the options, mentioned DNS support, DNS host name camp.

88
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,320
And you'll have an example as well.

89
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:52,250
So very conveniently you can access the information and as per your requirement, you can change the

90
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,480
options if you want.

91
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:56,480
So keep that in mind.

92
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:02,120
All the modules that I'm going to use, you can check in the documentation, see all the options, and

93
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:06,020
that's how we're going to execute this entire project.

94
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,170
If you want, you can simultaneously take notes or screenshots of modules, or then you can make a list

95
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,550
of modules that you've used.

96
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,910
Making the list of modules should be more than enough.

97
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:19,550
You don't need to really do anything because documentation is online available.

98
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:23,330
You can just search for the module and you can see everything with examples.

99
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,790
Let's do this first here.

100
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:28,340
We'll do an execution, then we'll come back.

101
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,050
So I'm going to save it.

102
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,730
Control this control key.

103
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,100
And I'll see VPC set up.

104
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,500
That's the commit message.

105
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:41,280
And I'm going to push it.

106
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:41,740
Control.

107
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,580
Shift key.

108
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,140
Push it to GitHub.

109
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,190
Okay.

110
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,290
And let's do it.

111
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:50,980
Pull.

112
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,210
Things are going to change now.

113
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,480
You'll have a variable directory and a VPC setup playbook.

114
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,030
Yes.

115
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,370
Okay.

116
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:03,540
Let's do an execution now.

117
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:06,190
Ansible hyphen playbook.

118
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,280
VPC set up.

119
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,650
If everything is good, this will work.

120
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:15,020
And that worked.

121
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:16,940
So it should have created a VPC.

122
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,850
Let's go and check in our console.

123
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,640
So you go to.

124
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,810
VPC.

125
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,330
Okay, so your VPC is.

126
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:32,910
So we have our VPC created.

127
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,860
We profile, underscore VPC.

128
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,230
Yeah.

129
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:41,760
And now we can we can create subnets and route tables and all those things in that.

130
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:43,180
That's the default VPC.

131
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,270
I recommend you just give a name.

132
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:51,720
Clearly default because you know, when you're doing this exercise you will tend to delete VPC.

133
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:56,340
Be careful, don't delete your default VPC or else you'll you'll be in a big mess.

134
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,760
Be careful with that.

135
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,550
Don't delete your default VPC.

136
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:04,810
So only play with your own VPC that you have created.
