1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:02,469
Okay.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,850
Next thing in the game, not Gateway.

3
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:10,010
So we have now we should have now a fully functional public subnet.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:13,850
You can start launching instance to that and you should be able to access them also.

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,760
But then now we have to focus on the private subnet.

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,200
We have created three private subnet and we need to create a net gateway for it and again, route table

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:22,310
for the net gateway.

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,980
Okay, so that's the module.

9
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,290
Easy to underscore, VPC, underscore Nat Gateway.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,280
It's going to create a new NAT Gateway and also allocate new elastic IP to it.

11
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:41,440
State subnet sorry, state present subnet ID so we have to mention this navigate will be created in

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,610
which subnet.

13
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,580
Obviously we're going to give the public subnet.

14
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,480
The Nat Gateway lives in the public subnet, so we give public subnet ID.

15
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,870
Now we have three private subnet.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:58,690
So for high availability we will need three NAT Gateway by the way, but that will turn out to be very

17
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,320
expensive for the project, for the exercises.

18
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:07,180
So you can just create one single nat gateway in one single public subnet to save some cost.

19
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,340
So Nat Gateway is not free.

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,660
So once you're done with this exercise, make sure you delete your NAT gateway first.

21
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:18,430
Even if you keep your VPC, that is fine, but make sure you delete the NAT gateway and release the

22
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:19,390
elastic IP.

23
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,370
So we're creating it in this subnet.

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:24,510
First public subnet.

25
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:25,220
Wait, yes.

26
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,320
So we're going to wait until this is up and running.

27
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:33,750
Not gateway takes time to come up region you specified and an option if exist do not create.

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,070
This is very important option.

29
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,320
If you forget to put this option and you keep executing your playbook as many as time you execute the

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,200
playbook, that many times not gateway will get created.

31
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:45,570
And then imagine the charges.

32
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:49,410
So make sure you don't miss this option.

33
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,090
Act if it already exists, do not create.

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:55,190
So this is going to make it important.

35
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,720
I told you not every module will, by default be important in cloud.

36
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,120
Some of them There are some tricks.

37
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,140
You have to use them.

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,310
And of course, then you register the output into a variable will next create the root table for it.

39
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:16,260
So a roundtable almost similar as we created for the public subnet.

40
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,340
But this is going to route the traffic to Gateway into the Nat Gateway, which we are storing over here.

41
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,690
Navigate to underscore out that has the key nat underscore gateway underscore ID and you will get the

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:31,560
NAT gateway ID feel free to use debug module.

43
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,500
After your task and print the output that you have stored.

44
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,900
Print the variable that your stored so you will know the key name are correct or not.

45
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,150
As the name of the model is debug.

46
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,000
It's very good and very helpful in debugging things.

47
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:51,330
Printing is the first part or the main part in debugging printing the values of variables.

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:51,780
Right.

49
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:52,740
Okay.

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,940
So again, this is the module it's creating in our VPC in the region that we specify the name subnets.

51
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,610
So private subnet IDs three private subnet.

52
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:09,390
This route table is 43 private subnet and all the traffic is going to go to the net gateway for this

53
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:11,130
and we store the output.

54
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,160
Let's see if this commit this.

55
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:21,190
See that gateway and multiple.

56
00:03:22,460 --> 00:03:23,060
Commit.

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,320
Yeah.

58
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,350
Let's pull it.

59
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,810
Well, you not verify the indentation, but let's execute and find out.

60
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:00,660
So creation of that gateway takes time and I'm going to pause my screen and come back one when this

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:01,710
is completed.

62
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,550
Okay, So after a few minutes, that gateway got created.

63
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:10,700
Also, the route table for private subnets are created.

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,740
Let's check that.

65
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:15,490
Let's go to not gateways.

66
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,720
And then we go.

67
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,050
Then we have an add gateway.

68
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,330
Also, it has an elastic IP.

69
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:26,350
You can find elastic IP there itself, or you can check the elastic IP here.

70
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,350
So once if once you delete the nat gateway after a few minutes, you should also release the elastic

71
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:32,980
IP.

72
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:36,340
So it does not charge you for the elastic IP as well.

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:40,060
We should also have a round table now another out table, public round table.

74
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,030
It's attached to sorry, private root table.

75
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,850
It's attached to three private subnets.

76
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:50,590
And the route says all the traffic goes to Nat Gateway.
