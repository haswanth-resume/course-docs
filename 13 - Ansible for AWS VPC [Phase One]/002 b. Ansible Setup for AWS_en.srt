1
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,810
Okay, I'm logged in to my management console.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,640
Currently I'm in North Virginia region, but I will switch to Ohio region.

3
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,600
So as I told you, we need a region which has minimum three zones.

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,070
Or if you have only three zone, that is much better.

5
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:22,150
That's not really a mandatory requirement for this project.

6
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:25,600
But we need minimum three zones because we are in this project.

7
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,740
We're going to set up a VPC stack distributed in three zones.

8
00:00:30,040 --> 00:00:34,990
So you can select any region of your choice really, but should have minimum three zones.

9
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:37,150
So I'll be on a higher region.

10
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,920
So we'll launch easy, for instance, where we're going to install Ansible.

11
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:45,290
And let's go to S.E. to.

12
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:48,070
Instances.

13
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,870
Or forced easy to dashboard.

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,820
You see, it has three zones.

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:53,750
Yeah.

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,490
So we can go ahead with this.

17
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,800
Here we have launch instance button.

18
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:59,660
So let's say launch instance.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:03,330
We'll go with Ubuntu 1 to 20.

20
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,290
Should be fine.

21
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:06,830
1 to 18 is also good.

22
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,340
We'll go with RT to Micro.

23
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:14,530
We don't need any great compute power for to run our ansible because ansible really does not run anything.

24
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:18,590
It's going to be mostly working like a client only so it doesn't run any service.

25
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:21,470
We don't call it as a server, we call it a control machine.

26
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,840
So T2 Micro should be fine.

27
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,770
Let's go next.

28
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,700
One instance.

29
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,160
And while it's coming up we'll also provision it with ansible.

30
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:34,200
So we'll run apt update sudo.

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,130
Zero apt install ansible.

32
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,790
This is fine.

33
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:48,030
Now in ubuntu 20 they should give you latest version of ansible, but if you are on a 1 to 18, check

34
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,330
the installation document of ansible.

35
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:53,310
You need to add even the repository details.

36
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,960
So you add the repository detail.

37
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,510
It's going to install ansible from the ansible repository, but in 1 to 20 you can just say install

38
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:02,250
ansible and that should be fine.

39
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,610
Oh, of course.

40
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:12,740
We need to also add our interpreter part exclamation slash bin slash bash.

41
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:14,660
And then let's go next.

42
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,850
So you're going to take all default and just give it a name control machine.

43
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:24,230
Or you can just call it as control.

44
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,540
They should be good.

45
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,800
Create security group.

46
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,420
So we'll just create a security group.

47
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:30,320
It's pretty simple.

48
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:32,090
We just need to do a search to this.

49
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,280
So we'll just name Ansible security group and we'll say 22 from my IP.

50
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:39,200
Let's go.

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
Next lunch.

52
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,940
Okay, Let's create a key pair.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,290
So create a keeper.

54
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,780
Let's name it as Ansible hyphen Ohio.

55
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,150
Python key.

56
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,450
Download.

57
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,560
And, let's say, launch instance.

58
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,260
We'll wait for a minute or so.

59
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:09,360
Our instance is up.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,470
Let's log in to it.

61
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,820
Let's copy the public IP.

62
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,950
Let's see.

63
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:17,600
It's a search for nine keys in the downloads directory.

64
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:23,160
Principal Ohio is certainly open to.

65
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:26,940
And we're in.

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,090
Okay, let's check the Ansible version.

67
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:32,010
We should already have no ansible.

68
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,680
2.9.6.

69
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,160
That's latest version.

70
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,050
If you're using ubuntu 18 as I told you, use the ansible repository to install ansible from.

71
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:49,740
You can find the steps in the ansible documentation installation section talking about ansible documentation.

72
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:55,650
If you already have used ansible to do some cloud automation, you know there is a setup.

73
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,760
If you have not done cloud automation ever with Ansible.

74
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:07,430
So it's better you go through the documentation and find out what all you need to write a playbook and

75
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:10,640
make it working or get it working for cloud automation.

76
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,710
Okay, so Ansible is documentation.

77
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,779
That's what I Google and click on it.

78
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:21,510
So we specifically using it as.

79
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,670
So you can read about it.

80
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:26,090
You see, it's going to talk about board two three module.

81
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:29,510
The installation happens on local host.

82
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,750
And for authentication your account details you need to export these keys, access key and secret key.

83
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,590
So you need to have an IAM user.

84
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:43,510
With Access Key and Secret key, and you need to give the right policy so it can perform the task.

85
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:48,790
Now, ideally, it's an exporting variable should be fine.

86
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:55,490
Or if you want to store it into variable, you can use Ansible vault to encrypt your access key and

87
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:56,270
secret key.

88
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,730
But whatever the case, do not mention your access key and secret key in your playbooks.

89
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:03,800
Do not mention it.

90
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,750
You need to mention it outside.

91
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:11,060
Either you export the variable on the system or you first encrypt it.

92
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,650
And then you can access it.

93
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,310
Can.

94
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,800
Or better if you're already on it.

95
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,630
Like I'm using easy to instance, and from there I'm going to run Ansible playbook.

96
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:25,280
The better practice over here should be using roles, easy to roles.

97
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:28,400
I am roles which you're going to attach to, easy to.

98
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,050
So that's what we'll do.

99
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,460
So we'll go to I am service and we'll create role.

100
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:42,690
So this rolls will save you from the trouble of access Key and secret key managing access.

101
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,320
Secret key?

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,510
Because there's always chance of exposing those keys, especially when you're using it with version

103
00:05:48,510 --> 00:05:49,890
control by mistake.

104
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:56,850
You put it on GitHub public repository and the hackers bots are going to pick that up automatically

105
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:01,230
and do bitcoin mining on your account or even hijack your account.

106
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:03,960
So be careful with the access key and secret key.

107
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:11,100
So it's better easy to instance, you just create a role, let's say easy to next permission.

108
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:17,850
And I'm going to give you full admin access to this because I'm going to do a lot of things with Ansible

109
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:18,330
Playbook.

110
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:21,070
I'm going to launch VPC UCC two.

111
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:25,710
So you can specifically find your policies and enter it to be more secure.

112
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:28,410
I'm going with Administrator access.

113
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,760
Let's give this a name.

114
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,560
We'll name it as Ansible admin.

115
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,510
Yeah, I'll sleep with that.

116
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:46,510
Okay, so I have a roll created ansible admin and I'm going to assign it to my ec2 instance, my control

117
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:47,170
machine.

118
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:52,930
We go to instance settings modify iam role.

119
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,650
Will select our role and civil admin.

120
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,050
If you don't find it yet after creating, just do a refresh and you should find it or you can use it.

121
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,840
Created from here.

122
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,080
Also.

123
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,650
That's new thing.

124
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:04,550
That's nice.

125
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,930
Let's deceive.

126
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:13,260
Now let's test it.

127
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,220
So to make a test, I can use this command.

128
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,270
Eight plus six.

129
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:19,280
Get caller I.D..

130
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:20,970
I get caller identity.

131
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,790
So if this works, your authentication is working.

132
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,270
You can see the road name there.

133
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,760
What role is being used?

134
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,960
Oh, and by the way, to run this command, you need to have a SQL.

135
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:42,600
So if you're on Ubuntu, you can just say sudo apt install a cli, install a cli first a c ally.

136
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:51,850
And then you can run that command or you can run you run any other CLI command to test your authentication.

137
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,000
So our authentication is really working with the roles.

138
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,360
Now we can move ahead.

139
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,560
Once again, this is important.

140
00:07:59,650 --> 00:08:07,960
So I'm telling this once again, do not put your access key and secret key in your playbooks just to

141
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,950
sample this.

142
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,000
I will show you.

143
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,750
Let's go to a module in module.

144
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:17,310
So this is easy to module of Ansible.

145
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,440
And you can do all this, right?

146
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,590
You can launch an instance with this.

147
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,520
You're going to see that.

148
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:29,950
But it will also have options for access key and secret key.

149
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:35,799
I see that it is access can a secret key.

150
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,750
So you can mention that, right.

151
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,840
So that module, that task is going to use this access key to authenticate to your account.

152
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:48,250
But if you're practicing, you may put it on a public repository like GitHub.

153
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,250
Public repository, and this can be seen by everyone.

154
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,710
Okay, So this turns out to be very dangerous.

155
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:58,960
So avoid mentioning access key in secret kind of playbook just to be safe.

156
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,360
Either export them or if you're already on us, just use the rules as I did.
