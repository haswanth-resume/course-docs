1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,470
So that did it.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:04,550
Okay.

3
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:07,900
Now we need an Internet gateway for our public subnet.

4
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:10,270
So we'll create an Internet gateway.

5
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,070
Let's say.

6
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:18,470
Internet gateway set up.

7
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,190
Easy to underscore, but there's no hyphen.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,900
What's taking hyphen automatically?

9
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:30,250
AC to underscore VPC underscore GW.

10
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,930
That's the name of the module.

11
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:38,560
Okay, first thing VPC ID, I can really copy it from there itself.

12
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,220
See that?

13
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,740
Because I'm already using it in the other module.

14
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,560
So in this VPC, I'm going to create this Internet gateway.

15
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,990
Again, check the documentation.

16
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:52,480
You have this option VPC ID in this module region also.

17
00:00:53,830 --> 00:00:54,940
That's convenient.

18
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:59,070
State also see.

19
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,950
You know, you just need to put hands on few cloud models and then things will become very easy.

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,510
Resource tags.

21
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,940
But see, these two are very different module.

22
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,350
It was check again.

23
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:23,420
I know for sure that this option is available in this module, but don't copy paste options from different

24
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,110
different modules.

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,010
There is a chance that this option may not be available in this module.

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,720
These are two different models.

27
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,690
But I know for sure it's available, so I'm putting that.

28
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,640
And of course, I want to register the output.

29
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:38,870
I have to change this name.

30
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:40,820
Name it.

31
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,750
As we profile GW Internet gateway like that.

32
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:47,390
Register the output.

33
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,120
Registering to GW underscore out.

34
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,030
That should create an Internet gateway.

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,370
Let's see if this.

36
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:01,620
GW.

37
00:02:06,590 --> 00:02:07,340
Control shift.

38
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,229
Key push.

39
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:23,900
Ansible hyphen playbook.

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,060
VPC setup.

41
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,210
So now this should create a new internet gateway for us.

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,730
By checking all our subnets.

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,480
Well, there is a problem.

44
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,350
Oops.

45
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:39,810
Oh, that's a genuine mistake.

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:44,910
Register is saying that it's not a supported parameter.

47
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:48,350
Okay, then I can quickly understand that Why?

48
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,120
Why it's happening.

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,950
It's thinking register is is an option.

50
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:53,410
Because I made indentation mistakes.

51
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:57,430
Register should be in line with the module.

52
00:02:58,150 --> 00:02:59,740
Yeah, like that.

53
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,750
Okay, let's fix that.

54
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,300
Let's pull the changes.

55
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,590
And let's execute.

56
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:32,630
And there you go.

57
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:34,240
Internet Gateway got created.

58
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,120
Let's check it.

59
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:40,800
Okay.

60
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,620
That's up there.

61
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:41,750
Yeah.

62
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:42,250
Sorry.

63
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,690
Internet gateway there.

64
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,700
And you should see the Internet gateway.

65
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,970
Again, there is an existing internet gateway of default VPC.

66
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,740
Just name it as default, something that it's easily recognizable for you.

67
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:59,040
So you don't accidentally delete your Internet gateway.

68
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,750
And then you'll have no internet to your CD instances which are in default.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,730
VPC can.

70
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:10,360
Okay, so we have created Internet Gateway.

71
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:17,300
This is for the public subnet to route traffic, but the route table will tell the public subnet to

72
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:20,480
go and access this internet gateway and vice versa.

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,820
So we need to create a route table now and map it to our public subnet.

74
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,760
Again, like the drought tables here.

75
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,710
Existing drought table.

76
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:35,600
And if you see it's map to it's not map to any subnet this drought table.

77
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:38,460
Okay.

78
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,570
Wait a second.

79
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:41,910
No, I'm looking at a right wrong place.

80
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,630
Yeah, There.

81
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,360
That's that table.

82
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:53,700
As these three subnets, or he can say this three public subnet of default VPC has this route table.

83
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:59,500
And it's routing the traffic, all the traffic to Internet gateway like that.

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,620
We need a route table for our public subnet as well so it can route the traffic to the Internet gateway.

85
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,390
So next we're going to create.

86
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,920
Roundtable.

87
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,190
Okay.

88
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,400
That's the module.

89
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,370
Easy to underscore.

90
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:15,830
VPC.

91
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:17,150
Underscore root table.

92
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:20,990
Again mentioning VPC, ID mentioning the region.

93
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:23,850
And let's also give it a tag.

94
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:24,770
Tags.

95
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:27,170
Name.

96
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:32,920
We profile hyphen pub arty.

97
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:35,100
Okay, This is just a tag.

98
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:36,580
You can give anything if you want.

99
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,090
Now this is for which subnets.

100
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,670
So you have to mention the subnets is an option here subnets and you have to mention the list of subnets.

101
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,890
So three public subnets.

102
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,310
So we have to give the variables here which we have only stored.

103
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,460
So Pop's about right.

104
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:01,860
If you want, you can print it.

105
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,410
Using debug module.

106
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:10,140
But there is a key in that called a subnet, which has the key caller's ID that is going to return you

107
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:11,640
the subnet idea of that.

108
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:16,080
Okay.

109
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:16,560
Like that.

110
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,540
Similarly for all the others.

111
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:24,610
The variables I'm giving in a proper format.

112
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,010
You see, it's very easy for me to use and change them.

113
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,680
Like pops up, one pops up, two pops of three.

114
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:34,420
I don't even need to go there and see the variable name, right?

115
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,480
Because if it's a proper format, it's easy to follow.

116
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:38,920
Okay.

117
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:45,280
So those are the subnets for the in this row, for this route, table and routes now where the traffic

118
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,630
should be rounded routes.

119
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,170
So destination.

120
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,990
So this is list of routes.

121
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:55,630
So it's going to be hyphen and the destination.

122
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,080
Right.

123
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,840
0.0.0.0/0.

124
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:03,220
So all the traffic is routed to.

125
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,930
Gateway.

126
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,510
So option Gateway underscore ID.

127
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:17,600
So the internet gateway guide so ICW dot underscore out.

128
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,940
Dot gateway.

129
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:27,710
Underscore ID and store its output.

130
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:31,380
Make sure registers in the proper indentation.

131
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,480
Register.

132
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,230
Bob.

133
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:35,500
Artie!

134
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,350
Underscore out.

135
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:45,000
I'll just see small out if that's looking a little complicated.

136
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,460
You're not sure about the option?

137
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,300
Just checking the documentation.

138
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,050
VPC.

139
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,540
Easy to underscore VPC underscore table.

140
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,040
Kemp, You can see all the options that I have used.

141
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,720
Routes.

142
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:03,750
State subnets.

143
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,310
Right.

144
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:09,410
You can see state an array of subnets to add to this route table.

145
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,820
Write the list array.

146
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,430
And you can see the example very easily.

147
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:18,650
Now, documentation is the king.

148
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:22,160
And you follow the king generally.

149
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,000
Okay.

150
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,170
Let's go back.

151
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,270
That's going to create a round table.

152
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,560
Let's see if this committed.

153
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,960
Routing table for public subnet.

154
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,030
Commit and let's push.

155
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,800
Let's just check the indentation once again.

156
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,510
Yeah.

157
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,140
Okay.

158
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,010
Seems good.

159
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,930
Let's go get pull.

160
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,750
Let's execute the playbook.

161
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,300
So everything is done.

162
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:08,670
We have it is now going to create a route table map all our public subnet with it.

163
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,510
And we'll make sure the traffic is forwarded to Internet Gateway.

164
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:17,220
Now that's a success.

165
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,220
Let's see that.

166
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,120
Okay, let's refresh this.

167
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:25,680
Yeah.

168
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,360
So there you go.

169
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:28,200
October.

170
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,350
So Route 0.00/0.

171
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:42,240
Forwarding the traffic to our Internet Gateway Subnet Association three public subnets are mapped out.

172
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,160
You can go to the subnets and from there you can see this round table, right?

173
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,480
And this existing, this is default.

174
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:52,140
So we name it as default underscore.

175
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,050
And so I don't accidentally make any change to it.
