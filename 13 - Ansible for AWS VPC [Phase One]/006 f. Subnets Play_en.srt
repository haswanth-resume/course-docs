1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,440
Okay, so that's done.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:04,470
Let's go next let's create now subnets in those VPC.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,110
First, I will create a public subnet.

4
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:18,690
That's the name of the task I'm giving the model Is this easy to underscore, VPC, underscore subnet,

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,250
and you can mention all the options.

6
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:26,430
The first option we're interested in mentioning is the VPC ID, in which VPC do you have to create your

7
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,510
dimension that right.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:28,590
So.

9
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:31,600
How do we know?

10
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:34,050
Well, we have stored the output VPC out.

11
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,130
Yes.

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,930
And that should have the ID so you can print it.

13
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:41,250
You can debug this.

14
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,220
I will add, you know, like a debug option there.

15
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:49,180
So debug task so you can see the output.

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,580
The that.

17
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,370
VPC out.

18
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:01,410
So the entire execution is going to be like that.

19
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:05,190
We execute a task, we store the output, and then we use it.

20
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:11,820
So if you're not sure about the key inside that, then just print that and you can see.

21
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,610
The keys and the sub keys inside there and the values inside that.

22
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:26,190
Other options region have specified again Region variable a z zone variable Zone one.

23
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,960
But we have their zone one.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,060
So first public subnet will be in zone one.

25
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,260
That's zone one.

26
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,700
State present.

27
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,360
So again, that is also mentioned cider.

28
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,590
Bob.

29
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:43,490
Sub one cider pops up.

30
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,190
Nice name.

31
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:45,560
Okay.

32
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:45,860
Yeah.

33
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:49,490
So pub sub one cider.

34
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,220
So that's going to be the value for it.

35
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:56,630
A few more.

36
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,820
Option map underscore public.

37
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:04,660
So we're going to launch easy to instance under this public subnet and they should automatically get

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,380
a public IP.

39
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,310
So map public.

40
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:13,210
Yes that option also tags resource underscore tags.

41
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,790
So name.

42
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:22,180
Otherwise it will not show the name in the tags and limit us v profile hyphen pub.

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,310
Sub one.

44
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:26,590
Yeah.

45
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:31,340
And again, store the output into a variable register.

46
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,970
Pub sub pub sub one underscore out.

47
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,170
Okay, that should create one public subnet with all these details.

48
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,430
Let's test it.

49
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,200
Save it.

50
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:50,600
Control K.

51
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,050
Comet sub one.

52
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,030
Control.

53
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,840
Shift k.

54
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:00,710
Push it.

55
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,100
And let's first pull it.

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,400
Yeah.

57
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,720
So let's check it.

58
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,010
All right, let's test it.

59
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,120
What is not a new line character there?

60
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,450
I have not given any one character that give it.

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,790
That looks really ugly.

62
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:29,210
Okay.

63
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,080
I would once again, same commitment.

64
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,910
I'll give.

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,490
Control shift key.

66
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,130
Now this is much better.

67
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,570
Okay, let's do the execution now.

68
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,510
And Sybil hyphen Playbook, VPC setup.

69
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,600
We already have a VPC, so it's not going to do anything.

70
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:08,090
And we got an indentation error.

71
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,070
And let's fix it also.

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,350
Yeah, I was just showing you.

73
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:17,339
So you know, you will get such kind of errors, indentation errors, which are very common and it's

74
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,050
very easy to see it in the ID.

75
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,060
That's what I wanted to point out, actually.

76
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:23,220
See, that's an error I made.

77
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:24,550
Right.

78
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,680
So this should be the same line as the name, right?

79
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,270
And I've given here four spaces.

80
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,050
This is fine.

81
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,730
If you want, you can just reduce it to two space or one space.

82
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,510
But I have not given this space.

83
00:04:35,510 --> 00:04:37,460
It has given it automatically.

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,920
And so even by using ID, there is chances of making mistakes like this.

85
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,770
So just check your code once again.

86
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,760
You should be fine.

87
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:50,330
All right.

88
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:52,850
It's in the same line as everything you can see there.

89
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:57,580
That line dropping right register is in the same line as easy to write.

90
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,240
All these options are in the same line.

91
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,570
Then you have indentation for the resource tag names option.

92
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:09,170
So verify that this is a very common error and very simple actually to find out.

93
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,060
So let me save this.

94
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,020
Control shift.

95
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,990
Key push.

96
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,530
Get pull.

97
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,270
That's executed once again.

98
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,400
And that is good.

99
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:39,970
Yeah.

100
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:40,810
Yeah.

101
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,110
Sorry.

102
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,270
Yeah.

103
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,040
No, it's good.

104
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:46,120
So it created a one single public subnet in our VPC.

105
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,630
I just wanted to show you this.

106
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,370
And we stored the output in our printing it VPC output.

107
00:05:52,210 --> 00:05:58,450
All right, so you get VPC there, you get the ID.

108
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,580
Night we had.

109
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:07,150
So variable name dot VPC, dot ID gives you the VPC ID like that.

110
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,290
All the task.

111
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,200
We're going to store the output and we're going to use it if you want.

112
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,480
You can just use a debug module and print it.

113
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:16,270
I'm going to comment the debug module after this.

114
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,470
Because that's going to be too much of output.

115
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,190
Commanded.

116
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:24,500
Okay.

117
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:27,650
Now, since you understood how to do that, let's Right.

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,500
Let's put all the other subnets.

119
00:06:29,510 --> 00:06:33,750
We have total six subnets to create one we have already given.

120
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:38,520
Now give five other subnet information and it's going to be as similar as this.

121
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:40,100
Just the names will change.

122
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:40,850
Okay.

123
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,840
Next task.

124
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:42,560
Similar.

125
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,770
As I said, names are going to change because we're using all variables.

126
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:51,500
Second public subnet rpc ID region zone two.

127
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,510
Second VPC sorry.

128
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,960
Second subnet in second zone State Prison CIDR.

129
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,510
Again, we're picking up from the variable file.

130
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:02,980
Yeah, that one.

131
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,870
My my public.

132
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:06,520
Yes.

133
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,640
Resource tag.

134
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,080
And let me change the name.

135
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:18,980
We profile and we store the output into variable pops sub underscore out.

136
00:07:20,810 --> 00:07:21,960
Third public subnet.

137
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:23,060
Again, similar.

138
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,710
This is going to be in zone three.

139
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,690
CIDR is different.

140
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,140
And the name, of course, and storing it the output into a variable.

141
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,120
So three public subnet there.

142
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,430
And let's test at least this much first.

143
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:38,730
Save it.

144
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,320
Not run.

145
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:41,820
Save it.

146
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,230
Commit.

147
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:52,570
Some one, two three Bob some commit message.

148
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:56,890
You should give a proper correct message when you're working in a project.

149
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,100
Oh, yeah.

150
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,370
Control shift key.

151
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,070
Bush.

152
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,060
It will.

153
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,970
Ansible hyphen.

154
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,440
Playbook.

155
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:15,940
VPC.

156
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,680
Setup.

157
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,520
So VPC is already there.

158
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:22,350
First public subnet is already there.

159
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,790
So it's going to create the second and third public subnet.

160
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,960
Okay, let's check that.

161
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,060
Let's go to subnets.

162
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:33,700
We should see three public subnet.

163
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,020
Yeah, three subnet.

164
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:39,760
Actually, there's nothing public about this subnets yet, but we got it right.

165
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:40,659
20.1.

166
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:42,159
20.2 23.

167
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,059
Yes.

168
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,410
Yeah.

169
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,200
Yeah.

170
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,130
This is better.

171
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,260
20.1, 20.2 23.

172
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,520
And they are scattered across three zones to A, to B, to C.

173
00:08:55,530 --> 00:08:58,590
Yeah, and they're definitely part of our own VPC.

174
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:00,530
Right.

175
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,710
That's our VPC.

176
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,420
So we did good.

177
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,940
Let's now create other three subnets.

178
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:08,040
We're going to name them as private subnet.

179
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,240
Three private subnet.

180
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:15,300
So let's go to intelligent and almost similar, but these are going to be private subnet.

181
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,110
So after these three public subnet, three private subnet.

182
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,450
So you see nothing much changes.

183
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:27,390
You can really copy paste your task and just change the names and the variables of course.

184
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:30,600
So creating one private subnet in zone one.

185
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:35,070
So first private subnet in zone one, that's the CIDR range.

186
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:42,550
Yeah, that 140 and we'll have 4.05.0 and 6.0.

187
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,160
So this is 4.0 in zone one.

188
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,150
This is five zero in zone two.

189
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:56,830
And this is 6.0 in zone three.

190
00:09:58,610 --> 00:10:00,890
And we are naming them as private subnet.

191
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,620
And also remember, we are storing its output.

192
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,430
Yeah, which will be useful later.

193
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,880
I'm going to see if this comet.

194
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,340
Yeah, it was new code.

195
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,340
So three new subnets.

196
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,620
Private one.

197
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,490
Private two.

198
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:43,540
Private three.

199
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:45,760
To execute.

200
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,660
Okay, let's check that.

201
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,010
Let's refresh.

202
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:08,980
And you should have know three private subnet.

203
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,540
One, two, three.

204
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,600
And so.

205
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:14,480
Now.

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,110
That's public.

207
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,740
Sorry.

208
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,050
All right.

209
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:20,230
You know what?

210
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,670
I should do it like this.

211
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,810
4.05.06 or three zero.

212
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:32,680
Private subnet one private subnet two private subnet three in our VPC and they should be into three

213
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:36,790
different zones as same as public subnet two A to B to C.

214
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,840
That's nice.
