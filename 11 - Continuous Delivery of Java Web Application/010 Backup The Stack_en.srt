1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:07,570
We're going to talk about now how to take data backup of CD Stack Jenkins Nexus and Sonar Cube.

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:15,160
So if you have the backup of all the data that we have created, then we can safely delete our instances

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,990
and recover our data.

4
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:22,330
Whenever you want, whenever you want, we can recreate these instances and restore all the data that

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:23,890
we have taken the backup of.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:27,510
Now, that is one reason of taking data backup of CD stack.

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:32,680
The other reason is we are going to use this backup in our cloud formation project, in cloud formation

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:33,400
project.

9
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:40,120
We will automatically set up the entire CD stack and restore all our data.

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,010
I will also show you how you can then restore your entire CD stack.

11
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:50,770
Okay, let's see the steps that we are going to take to do this entire backup.

12
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:55,180
So we need an S3 bucket, so we're going to create an S3 bucket.

13
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:57,090
You're to create.

14
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:03,360
I am role with SE three access and we're going to attach this role to all our instances.

15
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,210
Jenkins Nexus Ownership Server.

16
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,610
And if you are in continuous delivery projects and you have a Tomcat setter on an easy two instance,

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,790
then you have to attach this role to Tomcat Server also because you're also going to copy two configuration

18
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,140
files to S3 bucket.

19
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:23,320
Then we log into Jenkins instance.

20
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:25,750
We're going to shut down the Jenkins service.

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,880
We're going to clean up all unnecessary data.

22
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,250
Jenkins Home Directory will be huge in size and there'll be some unnecessary data like workspace, which

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,930
you really don't need to take backup, which can be generated any time you run the job.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,860
So we'll clean such data.

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,010
Then we'll archive our Lib Jenkins directory.

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,530
We're going to use Star Command, so we'll create a tarball.

27
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,560
Will install a clean Jenkins.

28
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:55,060
And we'll copy the Jenkins archive to the S3 bucket that we created in the first step.

29
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,300
Similar way we log into the Nexus server.

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:04,960
We shut down the Nexus service, will archive OPPT Nexus Directory and this directory we have installed

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,580
Nexus in our project.

32
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:13,540
We're going to install a blue sky in Nexis.

33
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,560
Will copy Nexis archive to the same S3 bucket.

34
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,990
So the same S3 bucket will copy all the data.

35
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,250
Then we log into Sonar Cube Server.

36
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,400
And here we have actually two things to take back up.

37
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:32,340
So we'll first shut down this owner service will archive's OPPT Sonar Cube Directory where we have installed

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,450
on our cube server.

39
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:38,300
We are also going to archive our PostgreSQL directory.

40
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:45,170
We're going to install a blue sky and we'll copy sonar cube and Postgres Kill Archive to the same S3

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:45,800
bucket.

42
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:55,350
So then keep note of the S3 bucket that you have created and also the archive file names, because we

43
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:58,410
are going to use them into our cloud formation project.

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:05,700
And in any case, you want to recover, restore your stack, you can use this archive to restore your

45
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,300
data.

46
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,920
I'm in my management console and I have these many instances.

47
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,300
I have a Nexus server.

48
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,610
So in the server, Jenkins instance, if you're in continuous integration project, then you'll only

49
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,630
have these three instances.

50
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:24,720
If you're in continuous delivery project, you should be having database Windows Server and application

51
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,800
server Tomcat.

52
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:27,750
We're going to take backup of Nexus.

53
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:33,000
So Owner Server Jenkins and also a few configuration file from our Tomcat server.

54
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:37,110
We're not going to take any backup of DB and Windows Test Server.

55
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,050
So let's see the Jenkins first.

56
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,450
Also keep in mind the password that you have set, because when we restore, we'll be having the same

57
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:55,780
set up.

58
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,380
Exactly.

59
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,530
So you need to log in with your same username and password.

60
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,150
So currently I'm in this state.

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,290
I have few jobs and I have a lot of plug ins installed.

62
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:10,580
If I happen to delete this Jenkins instance, I have to recreate it, which is easy to do.

63
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,070
Setting up Jenkins service is no big deal, but then we have to set up all these jobs and install all

64
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:17,320
the plug ins to come to this level.

65
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:22,540
If you're thinking taking off AMA, you can do that, you know AMA of this instance and storing it.

66
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,590
But then we have multiple instances and you may end up paying some money for the EBS volume if you're

67
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:30,910
keeping it for a long time.

68
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:32,260
Okay.

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:34,600
First thing first, let's create an S3 bucket.

70
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,370
I don't try to create the bucket with the same name as three.

71
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:47,790
Bucket names are unique, so you have to find your own names.

72
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,960
I Mm.

73
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,340
V Profile.

74
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:54,030
Hyphen cic hyphen stack.

75
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:55,800
Hyphen backup.

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:05:01,760
I'm creating an Ohio region, so choose a region that you usually use.

77
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:09,050
So the data copy and data backup restore will be faster, but it really doesn't matter where they are.

78
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:12,560
We can still backup and restore from bucket in any region.

79
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:16,100
I hope that's my unique name and I have not used that name.

80
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,810
Let's try create bucket.

81
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:23,120
So I created a bucket with this name.

82
00:05:24,030 --> 00:05:25,860
Now I'm going to create an I am role.

83
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,980
Go to rules.

84
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,380
Create role for easy to instance.

85
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,170
Next.

86
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,340
Policy so you can create policy.

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:48,000
To give access only to that S3 bucket.

88
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,740
Are much easier.

89
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:55,870
You can just say three full access policy, but then that will give access to all the S3 bucket.

90
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,880
If you are the only user of this account, then that is fine.

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,980
But if you are sharing with someone, then that could be a problem.

92
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:08,330
You have given some name to it.

93
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,800
Let's create role.

94
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:12,230
We profile CDs three full access.

95
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,490
Okay.

96
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,370
I will attach this role to all the instances.

97
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,320
Starting with sonar.

98
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,700
Sorry, Nexus.

99
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,980
Instance setting.

100
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,080
Modify em roll.

101
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,980
We profile CCD as three full access.

102
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,820
See.

103
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:38,750
Like that do for all the instances.

104
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,690
Give the stream roll to every instance.

105
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:24,590
Also, if you're in continuous delivery project, you'll have the application server give.

106
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,160
I am role access to this instance as well.

107
00:07:28,310 --> 00:07:32,600
If you are in continuous integration project now, then this much is fine.

108
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay.

109
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,180
So I log into Foss Jenkins instance.

110
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,570
Let's take backup of Jenkins first copy address.

111
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,400
So login to your Jenkins instance.

112
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,580
Switch to route user reset.

113
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,660
Stop.

114
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,430
Stop drinking service.

115
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:10,790
Yeah.

116
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,330
Let's go to var lib.

117
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,140
Okay.

118
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,000
You should see the Jenkins directory.

119
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:21,720
Let's see.

120
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,680
It's size.

121
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:32,640
Currently it's 428 and by year could be bigger because I have already cleaned some data.

122
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:38,299
But I'll show you how to clean the data.

123
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:39,770
Okay.

124
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:46,070
Let's do the cleanup of unnecessary files that we anyways get generated when you run the jobs first.

125
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,480
The repository.

126
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:54,180
Okay.

127
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,800
Dot m2 directory in lib jenkins dot m2.

128
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:58,900
You will see a directory called repository.

129
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:02,950
You can just delete that directory or you can just delete data from here.

130
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:07,700
Okay, because whenever we run the build job, it's going to increase, download the dependency and

131
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,750
keep it locally.

132
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,410
So we don't need this when we restore.

133
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,060
Okay.

134
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,120
Other data is workspace.

135
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,590
Workspace.

136
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,870
You will see the job in the directory name with the job names.

137
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:30,620
You can delete all this directory or you can get into this directory and delete the data.

138
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,910
Be careful what you're deleting.

139
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,560
RMF an RF star is a dangerous command, so be careful with that.

140
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:50,840
My recommendation you get into the directories and delete the data instead of deleting whole thing.

141
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,800
That's going to take a little while, but it's just one time backup.

142
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,230
Once you have the backup, then any time you can restore.

143
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:04,130
So we deleted dot MX to repository, we deleted the workspace.

144
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,970
Now one more thing is there if you are archiving your artifact.

145
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:18,230
Then you should have in jobs, you should have like for example, in build project job in the bills.

146
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:22,490
I should have this you should have this number one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

147
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:22,660
nine.

148
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:27,410
A number of times you ran the job whenever you said archive artifact.

149
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,660
You will create an archive over here like in this directory number name ten.

150
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,010
You have the archive.

151
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,290
So you see that there is an artifact over there, right?

152
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:42,320
What you can do is you can just delete these numbers.

153
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:49,520
The directory with the numbers, you can just delete them one, ten and nine and a half.

154
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,290
You may have different, different numbers.

155
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,660
So just delete those directories.

156
00:10:55,220 --> 00:11:00,080
If you have if you're doing archive in other jobs, also, you should have these number directories

157
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,470
in other workspaces also in this jobs directory.

158
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,610
So what you can do?

159
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,410
You can run the hyphen search.

160
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,560
You can see the size of your current directory.

161
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,820
You can say Do hyphen search star.

162
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,060
And I will show you the size of all the directory.

163
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,710
It's in CVS and me b so doesn't matter if you have like larger mobs.

164
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:24,170
Get into that and biz or GBS, get into that directory, find the number of directories and just delete

165
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:27,290
them because they will get generated anyways.

166
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:29,590
Okay.

167
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,190
So we deleted three things.

168
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:37,390
Dart aim to repository workspaces and in the jobs directory.

169
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:44,890
We have again workspace directories and this we have deleted directories with build number.

170
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:49,330
Now your Ratliff Jenkins size should be smaller if you run.

171
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:51,490
Do you have an asset in Radley Jenkins?

172
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,090
You will see something around 500 and be if you're seeing more, find out unnecessary things and delete

173
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,270
them.

174
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,710
Do not delete plugins.

175
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,200
We need those plugins.

176
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:03,220
Okay.

177
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,890
Now it's time to archive this.

178
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:12,400
We're going to say cha hyphen C, Z, V, F, and I'm going to name this as Jenkins.

179
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,300
Underscore.

180
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:21,440
CI cd jobs dot dot dot gz.

181
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,180
You can keep the same name.

182
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,910
It will be helpful in the cloud formation project, but if you have given different name, it's jobs.

183
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:34,550
S But if you're given a different name, no problem in cloud formation project will change the name.

184
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,720
You can change the name of the archives.

185
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:40,310
That should be fine, but note down the names.

186
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:44,240
So let's archive this.

187
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:47,310
Okay.

188
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,110
Now you have some dots on our cashier directory.

189
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:52,540
We could have cleaned that also, but that is fine.

190
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,460
This much size is fine.

191
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,540
We should have now.

192
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:01,940
The ball.

193
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,390
Let's check its size to you.

194
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,400
High as such.

195
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:08,810
Okay.

196
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,890
That's reduced.

197
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,450
If even if it's big size.

198
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:12,230
Okay, don't worry.

199
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:13,580
We're going to put it on S3 bucket.

200
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,590
It will be copied very quickly over there.

201
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,480
If you want, you can download it and keeping your local machine also.

202
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:25,500
Okay, now let's run a SE three step or if we have to install it publicly.

203
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:32,540
I already have it installed but still I'll show you apt install a c.

204
00:13:36,590 --> 00:13:36,920
Okay.

205
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:38,060
We have a IWC ally.

206
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:39,560
Now it's time to copy your data.

207
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,510
ewss3cp.

208
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:50,210
We're going to copy or jenkins if the tab does not work over here, i have to copy the file name.

209
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,010
Okay.

210
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,390
E w s.

211
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,830
s3cp.

212
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:00,890
And the bucket name is three colons slash slash.

213
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:02,900
So let me get the bucket name.

214
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,050
That's my bucket name.

215
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:11,500
They copy the name.

216
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,300
Don't create any subdirectories just in the bucket itself.

217
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,880
So they started copying.

218
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,720
You see, it's 348 and B and yeah, I didn't even complete my sentence and it has copied.

219
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:37,250
So as I told you, don't worry about the size even if you're not able to clean, clear or clean the

220
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,810
directories, that is also fine.

221
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,270
Okay, so one backup taken.

222
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:41,990
Let's see.

223
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:45,720
Good job.

224
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:47,650
Okay.

225
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:50,140
Let's do the same for the other other instances.

226
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,310
Now let's go to.

227
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:53,360
No nexus.

228
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,410
If you understood what you had to do, you can, you know, keep doing it.

229
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:01,960
Or if you still want to see, you can keep watching the video.

230
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,310
That is sent to a user.

231
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,490
It.

232
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:28,060
You should see an Excel directory in OPPT.

233
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,600
First, let's stop the Nexis service.

234
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:40,170
Okay.

235
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:43,680
Let's take it's archive cha hyphen c z vf.

236
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,340
Next is hyphen hyphen v pro hyphen pro dot GZ.

237
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,780
That's the name I have given.

238
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,050
Again, you can use the same name or you can use different name.

239
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,390
OC Archive taken a B+ 3cp.

240
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,600
I Strickland slash slash.

241
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,380
Same bucket name.

242
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,460
Done.

243
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,480
That was Foster.

244
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:22,470
Okay.

245
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,020
Let's log out from here.

246
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,000
If you want to continue and you know, with your stack, you can just start the Nexis and Jenkins service.

247
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:31,280
If you're done, you know, let it be.

248
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:31,930
Stop it.

249
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,760
Anyways, taking the backup, we can recover later.

250
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:40,680
So on the server.

251
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:58,290
Okay.

252
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,800
Here we have two things to back up.

253
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,730
One is Sona Ncube directory and then it's PostgreSQL.

254
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,760
Let's stop the sonar service first.

255
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,619
Oh, sorry.

256
00:17:10,619 --> 00:17:12,420
Its name is Soner Kub.

257
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,050
You.

258
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,319
Let's go to OPPT.

259
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,109
Okay.

260
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:22,400
Let's take it back up.

261
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:32,070
So in the cube hyphen V pro hyphen pro hyphen data z as the name I have given.

262
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:38,270
Back up, Deacon.

263
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,760
Let's copy it.

264
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:41,570
SE three cp.

265
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,670
P tarball and oc done also.

266
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,240
If you wish, you can start the ownership service.

267
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,740
But if you're done, just log out.

268
00:18:09,190 --> 00:18:09,580
All right.

269
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,120
If you're in continuous integration project, this is done.

270
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:14,380
If you're in continuous delivery project, then.

271
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,580
We only have one more server.

272
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:21,830
We're not going to take the data backup, but configuration file backup.

273
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:25,940
Which will be again using a cloud formation project.

274
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:36,310
If logging into the Tomcat server.

275
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,810
Get into your Tomcat home directory.

276
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,120
Yes.

277
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,720
Local Tomcat eight, I suppose.

278
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:53,240
Yeah.

279
00:18:54,980 --> 00:19:00,260
In the contradictory, you should have tomcat hyphen users dot xml that file.

280
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,270
We are going to copy it to our S3 bucket.

281
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:06,890
Same name.

282
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,090
We don't need to change it.

283
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:12,510
Okay.

284
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,250
That's done.

285
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:15,660
Okay.

286
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:21,590
Now in web apps, you should have a manager directory in that you have to have an INF.

287
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,210
Okay.

288
00:19:23,210 --> 00:19:28,550
There you should see context xml e plus 3cp copy this file.

289
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:36,990
Copied to the S3 bucket.

290
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:45,020
All right.

291
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:51,490
Okay.

292
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:53,830
Let's check our S3 bucket.

293
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,560
aws3 ls.

294
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:07,890
All right, once you're done, you should have Jenkins CD Jumpstart GZ Nexus Hyphen CD Hyphen V Pro

295
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:16,680
Hyphen Pro dot z so in Q hyphen V Pro hyphen pro dot pro hyphen data mktg z, tomcat users dot xml and

296
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,730
context xml.

297
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,860
You should have this in your S3 bucket.

298
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,030
No down the name.

299
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:22,730
No down the name of the S3 bucket.

300
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,560
We'll be using this in cloud formation project.

301
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,150
Okay, one quick way, a sample to how to restore manually this data.

302
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:32,310
Let's take example of Jenkins.

303
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:34,210
Okay.

304
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,450
So I'm going to launch an issue to instance.

305
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:42,480
I'd say first, let me just shut down all this instant state.

306
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,660
Stop.

307
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:46,380
I don't need it now, so I'm going to shut them down.

308
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:50,020
Okay.

309
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,040
I'm going to set up a Jenkins server now, so.

310
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:57,160
One two server 20 should be fine.

311
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,010
Due to micro.

312
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:01,420
Okay.

313
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,870
I'm going to set up the Jenkins service from user data.

314
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:08,830
So I have to say sudo apt update.

315
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:16,120
To make sure to give the best part.

316
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:27,310
Sudo apt install open JDK hyphen eight hyphen JDK f and y solo.

317
00:21:27,470 --> 00:21:35,060
APT install maven and whatever you need and just put it out there.

318
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:37,450
It should be fine.

319
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,870
And then Jenkins installation steps.

320
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:44,920
So the Jenkins installation documentation.

321
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,780
From there, I'm just copying this thing.

322
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,560
Commands.

323
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,140
Okay.

324
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,360
This will not work out.

325
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,240
We have to echo and put this into the file.

326
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,140
Okay.

327
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:05,050
So I'm saying sudo hyphen c ico.

328
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:07,940
And redirected to this file.

329
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:18,740
And finally sudo apt update and then sudo apt install jenkins.

330
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:21,320
Right now we know this is a fresh instances.

331
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,000
You'll be fresh jenkins up.

332
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,280
No jobs, no plugins, nothing.

333
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,760
Right.

334
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,830
This is fine now, but we'll see how we can restore from our data.

335
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,630
Restore.

336
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,720
Just give some name, restore, hyphen Jenkins.

337
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,620
Configure Security group.

338
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,950
I'm going to use some existing security group, genuine security group.

339
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,180
Launch, and I'll use a key that I already have.

340
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:55,040
Okay.

341
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:56,870
We wait for a few minutes.

342
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,180
We'll wait until this is entirely set up, and then we'll log in and we'll restore the data.

343
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:06,830
Now it's few minutes.

344
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:11,360
Now I will check whether the Jenkins service is up or not.

345
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:14,400
Okay.

346
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,840
Seems it's responding.

347
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:17,020
Okay.

348
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:20,330
Jenkins is up and we have to do the post installation step.

349
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:27,360
It's a fresh set up and then you can have to set up all the jobs and install all the plug ins and stuff.

350
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:31,020
We already have the backups, so we're going to restore from that backup.

351
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,240
So we'll log into this Jenkins instance.

352
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,130
It's copy type.

353
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,090
Okay.

354
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,410
So be the root user.

355
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:58,430
First thing you're going to do is you're going to stop the Jenkins service here so it doesn't interfere

356
00:23:58,430 --> 00:24:00,320
with our restore process.

357
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,290
Let's go to wire lib.

358
00:24:05,490 --> 00:24:05,860
Okay.

359
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:08,070
Ellis hyphen ld.

360
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,310
You should have the Jenkins directory.

361
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:12,450
Okay.

362
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:14,220
Also note down the ownership of this.

363
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,690
This is Jenkins user.

364
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,520
Once we restore this, ownership may change.

365
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:22,110
So you have to make sure you give this ownership back to this directory.

366
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,910
Okay, now we have a backup on the S3 bucket and we want to download it to our instance.

367
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,880
So I'm going to attach a role so it can authenticate.

368
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:35,160
I'm going to use the same role v profile.

369
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:37,650
The time of restoration.

370
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,630
If you're not seeing this at all, create another rule.

371
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:40,230
Simple.

372
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,100
Okay.

373
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,960
So that's the S3 bucket.

374
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:47,480
Yeah.

375
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,000
That's copy its name.

376
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,440
Let's go back to our Jenkins.

377
00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:01,760
So I'm going to say a s se three cb se three colon slash slash the bucket name.

378
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:02,390
Oops.

379
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:05,690
Bucket name slash.

380
00:25:06,370 --> 00:25:07,600
And the final name.

381
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,180
That one.

382
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:14,950
Yeah.

383
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,410
I can copy it from there.

384
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,520
Copy.

385
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:24,130
Okay.

386
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,510
And I'm going to say dot, so download it in this VAT lib directory.

387
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,520
Now I have to install a silly app.

388
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,190
Install a silly.

389
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:44,550
Okay.

390
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,270
Localize.

391
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:45,700
Install.

392
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,360
Now I can run the command plus three.

393
00:25:47,430 --> 00:25:49,910
Copy here.

394
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,540
Done.

395
00:25:57,770 --> 00:25:58,010
Okay.

396
00:25:58,010 --> 00:26:03,080
Now simply I'm going to say da x z v f extracted.

397
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,130
That's it.

398
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:14,540
It's going to override the files that you already have in Jenkins.

399
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:17,480
You did a Jenkins installation so that already Jenkins files.

400
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,790
It's gone.

401
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,230
All right.

402
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,220
A lot of files.

403
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:26,190
Check the permission.

404
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,890
If it's not good, just give Jenkins.

405
00:26:29,090 --> 00:26:29,700
Jenkins.

406
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,740
But if you take a backup.

407
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,720
Well, you know, tarball you're doing right.

408
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,390
We are archiving so it's going to preserve the permissions and all.

409
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:40,280
But it's a good idea anyways.

410
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:41,510
Recursively.

411
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,370
So all the files are Jenkins permission.

412
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,690
Now, let's start.

413
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:49,270
Jenkins service system say it'll start.

414
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,730
JENKINS That's going to load.

415
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,190
JENKINS With the data in the Jenkins directory and this is the data from previous.

416
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,820
Jenkins setup.

417
00:26:59,560 --> 00:26:59,860
Right.

418
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:01,100
Let's see that.

419
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,710
It's going to take a moment to come up.

420
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,620
Said Enter.

421
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,280
Okay.

422
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:16,210
Now login page.

423
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:16,510
Right.

424
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,810
So I remember the username and password that I have given.

425
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,140
Again.

426
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,130
And voila.

427
00:27:27,670 --> 00:27:29,470
Back from where we started.

428
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,710
Right now, I know you can take a backup.

429
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:37,000
You can take my of the instance, but then you have to pay for the storage cost.

430
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:45,790
But in any case, do this backup process because we need this in cloud formation project.

431
00:27:48,690 --> 00:27:48,930
Okay.

432
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:54,000
Now there will be in the jobs, there'll be all types of Nexus sonar, all tokens.

433
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,120
So you have to change all those things change the old IP right now, give the new IP in the jobs in

434
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:04,610
the next job and so on or cube job tokens.

435
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:04,830
Right.

436
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,480
All those things you have to change.

437
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:06,840
Right?

438
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,520
Then you can run the pipeline.

439
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:09,660
All right.

440
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:12,150
That's that's all in this video.

441
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,770
Thank you very much for watching.

442
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:15,840
Now you can continue with other videos.
