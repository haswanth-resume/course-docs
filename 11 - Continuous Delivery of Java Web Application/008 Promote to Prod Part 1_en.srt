1
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:05,370
In this lecture, we will see how to promote this to production environment.

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:10,990
Now for production environment, we'll create a separate production X cluster.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,890
So let's do that first.

4
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:14,560
We'll create a new cluster.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:18,650
We will also create a new Jenkins pipeline for production environment.

6
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:23,720
And then we will see how staging and production pipelines are connected.

7
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:25,430
Or maybe they are not connected.

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:26,690
We'll find that out.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:27,530
Okay.

10
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,410
So let's go to clusters.

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,590
And let's create a production cluster which will be similar to this.

12
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:38,800
I just name it as the real prod.

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:40,850
We'll keep.

14
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:42,800
Seems certain.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:46,780
VPC Forget and we'll just say create.

16
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:52,450
Okay.

17
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,840
My cluster is created.

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,500
Let's click on that and I will create a new task definition.

19
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:00,050
For the production.

20
00:01:00,050 --> 00:01:01,760
Create new task definition.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,560
Similar information.

22
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:07,520
The prod task, I will say.

23
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,170
Container name Vpro app.

24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,270
And the same UI which we used in staging.

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:18,750
Now we would like to promote the same image and not a different image.

26
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,250
So we'll give the same image.

27
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,160
You all container port 8080.

28
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,240
Just come down and let's go next.

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,150
Forget will keep it as it is.

30
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,370
Memory will reduce to two GB again.

31
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:35,340
It's come down.

32
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,600
And let's go next.

33
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,670
You everything and they create.

34
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:51,480
Your task definition created to close this notification, let's go to the cluster service clusters.

35
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,130
Prod.

36
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,040
And so this will say deploy.

37
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,240
Will they launch type?

38
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:04,550
He forget service.

39
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:05,630
Family.

40
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,360
Let's select our task definition.

41
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,300
So his name.

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:15,150
The Pro app prod cc.

43
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,310
Networking.

44
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:21,270
Will they create new security group?

45
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,380
We'll give security group a name.

46
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:31,030
Again.

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:32,560
Make sure you add the prod.

48
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,330
So we will be editing the security group.

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,700
So you should be able to identify with its name.

50
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,210
Load balancer option.

51
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:43,360
Load Balancer.

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,280
Type Application Load Balancer.

53
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,290
Create new load balancer.

54
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,420
It's come down.

55
00:02:51,710 --> 00:02:53,060
Target group name.

56
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,110
Should a college GDP.

57
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,030
Health check pot slash login.

58
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,790
A grace period.

59
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:03,020
30 seconds.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,440
This is just similar as we created for staging.

61
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,390
Except the name is different.

62
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:10,620
In real time.

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:16,890
Also this will be similar, except you will be having more GB to your container's multiple containers.

64
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:23,070
But we want to keep things under three tier or very minimum on billing so we're creating similar to

65
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,850
staging.

66
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,060
So in real time also it will be similar to staging, except it will be bigger in size.

67
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,120
All right, let's go deploy.

68
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,110
Yeah.

69
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,880
It's not working, obviously.

70
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,720
Security group.

71
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,970
I did not add any rule whatsoever.

72
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:49,880
So I need to see add rule to DPI and we'll see just from anywhere.

73
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,940
And then we'll click on deploy.

74
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,030
Yeah.

75
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,370
Now that works.

76
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:56,030
Okay.

77
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,860
That is going to take some time by the time.

78
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:04,190
Let's go to our voice code or our code and write a new pipeline for production.

79
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:10,240
First I'm in my git batch, I'm in the repository, I'll get repository.

80
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:15,160
That's where I have my repository and I'm going to create a new branch here.

81
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,089
Git checkout, hyphen b prod.

82
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,310
Now this will be a separate branch in real time.

83
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,130
Also, you'll have a separate branch for production.

84
00:04:24,130 --> 00:04:27,760
Its name could be prod or main or master.

85
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,600
It could be anything.

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,230
The name that I'm giving is so you can understand and identify that this is for the production purpose.

87
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:37,330
But the name of the branch could be anything.

88
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:40,330
So I'm saying git checkout, hyphen b prod.

89
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:44,740
It's going to create a new branch from the CSA Jenkins branch.

90
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,370
All right.

91
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,550
And the Jenkins file we will be using will be from the pipeline directory.

92
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,390
So let's open the VTS code.

93
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:58,590
Margaret, you also need to push this new branch.

94
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,630
Now we can do it from VTS code also.

95
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,250
So if we go to.

96
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,070
So source control.

97
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,260
It's already saying, you know, this is the broad branch, right.

98
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:10,190
That is saying you should publish this branch, let's publish it.

99
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,870
So this goes to GitHub.

100
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:15,950
Okay.

101
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,000
You're going to GitHub.

102
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,680
Let's go to a repository and you see that it is broad that has a recent push there.

103
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,210
So we have the broad branch on GitHub also.

104
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,790
Now again going back to voice code.

105
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:31,200
All right.

106
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:34,860
So we are not going to use the stage pipeline Jenkins file.

107
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:37,320
We will be using the prod pipeline.

108
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,400
Jenkins file.

109
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,730
Now, this code, this pipeline code will be pretty simple.

110
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:46,250
We are not going to build and push our image.

111
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,980
We'll be just deploying it to production easiest cluster.

112
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:57,980
So we need to clean most of the things here and I will just replace it simply so you can clean that

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,170
extra stage.

114
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:06,830
So here this is the same slack function color map environment variable.

115
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,140
Actually we don't even need these one.

116
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,240
Not pushing an image from here.

117
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:18,190
If you're pulling in, you're pushing an image from here, then you can mention them.

118
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,150
Stage will be deployed to prod x.

119
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,290
And exactly same step.

120
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,210
So the cluster variable value you to make sure you give this cluster variable in value should be your

121
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,650
production cluster name.

122
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:35,930
Let me just verify that once again for you.

123
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:38,680
Yes.

124
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,220
Clusters.

125
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:42,420
The probe prod.

126
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,660
So, yeah, I need to change that.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,590
Huh?

128
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:47,170
There.

129
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,780
And the service variable.

130
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,100
Let's check that also.

131
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,350
Let me just copy that.

132
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,150
I think it's the same.

133
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:06,430
Anyways, this boosted once again, okay, these two variables and then the same thing.

134
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:12,040
What we did for staging except here the cluster name is the production cluster name and the service

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,390
is the production service and then of course the slack notification.

136
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,200
That is it.

137
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:17,950
That's all.

138
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:18,910
Just save it.

139
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:20,730
All right.

140
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,780
And then let's push it.

141
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:25,290
Commit and push.

142
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:31,770
So there is no pipeline yet on Jenkins will create a pipeline also for this one.

143
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,220
Let's just push it first and see prod x pipeline.

144
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:39,970
Control less.

145
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,870
That Mark.

146
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,580
Thinking changes.

147
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,440
Okay.

148
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:47,250
That worked.

149
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,940
Now let's go to Jenkins and create a new pipeline.

150
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:54,630
For production, which will be similar to this one.

151
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,410
So it's a new item.

152
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:58,790
Wait.

153
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:03,070
Just copy the name from here first.

154
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:15,680
New item and I will see here Docker secede prod pipeline.

155
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,040
I would select here pipeline and I will say copy from.

156
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,450
Not one.

157
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,900
So simply replicate, right?

158
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,380
Clone the job and we'll change few things there.

159
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,130
So it's actually clone that is checked but.

160
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:39,620
And the branch was we need to change to prod.

161
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,320
John.

162
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,520
And that directory fraud pipeline directory we have in that.

163
00:08:49,660 --> 00:08:52,810
Look just confirmed that you will name once again.

164
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,400
Proud pipeline.

165
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,330
P capital.

166
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:56,080
P capital.

167
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,280
Yeah.

168
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,990
In that we have the Jenkins file.

169
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,710
Save.

170
00:09:01,530 --> 00:09:02,830
I think it's just a matter of testing.

171
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,140
Now, before that, let's go to X.

172
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,830
So let's try it.

173
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:09,390
One.

174
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,180
Okay.

175
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,500
Deployment current state to field.

176
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,600
Now we know what is happening here.

177
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:26,080
We did not make the target group health check change and we did not make the security group change for

178
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:26,530
production.

179
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:27,430
We did for staging.

180
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:27,940
Right.

181
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,540
So if we see, let's go back to your.

182
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,630
Great task.

183
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,910
See the task.

184
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:40,520
So what really is happening is it's trying to access that container, do the health check on the container

185
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,150
since the target group health check is wrong.

186
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,490
The container declares as unhealthy, and then it deletes that container.

187
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,120
Then it launches a new container.

188
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,930
Then that also goes unhealthy.

189
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:53,670
And this goes on and on.

190
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,280
So let's go to back to Target Group.

191
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,250
Well easy to target group you should find here.

192
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,680
Broad target group.

193
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:05,170
Go to the health check.

194
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:07,540
Edit.

195
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,490
Okay.

196
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:11,990
Traffic.

197
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,420
All right.

198
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,640
We need to change the port number here to 80.

199
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:15,180
80.

200
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,200
Yeah.

201
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,490
Not one thing.

202
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,840
So you change.

203
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:21,380
And then the security group.

204
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:27,220
Broad.

205
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:30,980
So security group inbound rule edit.

206
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:36,340
Look right there, idiot.

207
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:40,330
From any IPV four and.

208
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,860
88 from any IPV six.

209
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,490
Steve this.

210
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,370
Seem what we did for staging, but in staging we did it.

211
00:10:51,370 --> 00:10:55,420
As soon as we created the cluster in production, we just let it run.

212
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:02,670
Now this will work and sometime this will get stable in some time.

213
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,360
All these tasks are stopped.

214
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:12,480
But this task that is running now, it will be healthy and it will keep that task or the container.

215
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:14,410
Okay.

216
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,200
So wait for a few minutes, make sure it is stable, then test your pipeline.

217
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,350
So I'm going to pause my screen and resume after 5 minutes.

218
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,100
Okay.

219
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,530
Now it's time to test this production pipeline.

220
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,430
So I'm going to click on Build and now on this broad pipeline.

221
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,670
And we'll see what happens.

222
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:35,690
Okay.

223
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,720
My pipeline failed.

224
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:38,040
Let's look at the log.

225
00:11:42,790 --> 00:11:45,550
And edit awkward cluster not found.

226
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:52,060
Well, the cluster name is right, but the region I have mentioned is wrong.

227
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,320
So I will change the region to us.

228
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,190
West one where my cluster is just one.

229
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,360
Save it.

230
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,540
Comment and push.

231
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:11,850
Updated correct region code controllers for check mark.

232
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,170
That should trigger the pipeline automatically.

233
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:16,800
All right.

234
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,880
We have Web hooks.

235
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,770
So let's go back.

236
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,310
Let's see this.

237
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:23,600
Yeah.

238
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,490
It triggered.

239
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,920
Let's look at the logs.

240
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,930
Oh, it's already done.

241
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,960
Okay.

242
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,020
Nice.

243
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:35,910
Okay.

244
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,920
Let's let's check the X.

245
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,120
Prod.

246
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:41,920
Okay.

247
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,590
All right.

248
00:12:43,590 --> 00:12:44,160
Tasks.

249
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,540
There's already two task.

250
00:12:47,030 --> 00:12:47,570
The main task.

251
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:48,740
But two tasks are running.

252
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:49,310
So.

253
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,820
That one 4 minutes ago.

254
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:54,940
Now, this will go out of service in some time.

255
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,760
The newer one will be there if you see that the old task is taking time to go away.

256
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,480
It is probably you have opened the up load balancer.

257
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:07,300
You are there is a connection, so it's trying to drain the request.

258
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:13,630
If the request is completely drained, all the requests are coming to that container, then only it

259
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:16,000
will delete that container, that task.

260
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:21,910
So make sure you close all the tabs where you have opened the load balancer you are.

261
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:24,550
Okay, so this is it over here.

262
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:33,130
In the next lecture, we will see a proper process of how the pipeline runs, returns result, and then

263
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,110
how do we promote it to production?

264
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:38,270
The actual process I'm talking about.

265
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:41,380
Otherwise, your pipeline, both the pipelines are set.

266
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,620
They're working fine.

267
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,180
We'll just see how the real process is in the real time.

268
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,240
So wrap this up and join me in the next lecture.
