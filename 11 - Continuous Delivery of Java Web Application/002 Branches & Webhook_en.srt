1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,380
Welcome.

2
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:08,720
This project is basically the continuation of continuous integration project, which we did on Jenkins.

3
00:00:09,350 --> 00:00:12,650
So you should have all these three instances from that project.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:14,330
Just power them on.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,000
If you deleted them, you need to recreate.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,290
You need to do the complete continuous integration project that is the prerequisite site for this project.

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,100
Once you power on, make sure you update the security group rules to allow it to access from your IP.

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:42,200
So on Jenkins Security Group Rule 88 from anywhere 22 from your IP on a Nexus 22 from your IP 81 from

9
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,870
your IP and a Sony server 22 from your IP and 80 from your IP.

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:51,280
Once you update that, your update all your new IP is.

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,020
Get the Jenkins server public IP.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:54,910
Copy that.

13
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:01,090
Go to your GitHub repository, the same repository that we used in Continuous Integration Project.

14
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,060
Go to its settings.

15
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:06,710
The books.

16
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:09,580
Edit.

17
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:14,200
It might ask you the password to enter the password and login.

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,380
Update the Jenkins IP carefully.

19
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,200
There.

20
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,310
And let's see.

21
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,450
Update Webhook.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:33,840
And let's go to the recent deliveries.

23
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,450
And let's try.

24
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:39,500
To deliver this.

25
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:44,040
Okay.

26
00:01:44,180 --> 00:01:45,380
That's a success.

27
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,840
So the book is working.

28
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,200
Next.

29
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
We need to prepare our code.

30
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:56,400
We need to add Docker files and we need to arrange the Jenkins file for staging and production environment

31
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,480
in our source code.

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:02,260
So let's go to Vpro file project repository.

33
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:06,600
So go to our project repository at this link.

34
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:10,740
And you need to select the branch docker from here.

35
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:17,620
Make sure you switch to the branch docker, not anything else but Docker.

36
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,760
Click on this dropdown and we'll say download zip file.

37
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:26,740
And that's the save it in our downloads.

38
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,180
Okay.

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:28,930
In the downloads.

40
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,250
Let's extract it.

41
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,840
You extract all.

42
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,860
Extract.

43
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:38,660
Okay.

44
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:44,980
So you see that folder inside that you should have same folder once again, same name, and then you

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,850
have the Docker file.

46
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:49,540
So you need to copy this folder in the source code.

47
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay.

48
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:56,800
In the source code, I mean to say the same repository that we used in continuous integration project.

49
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,300
So if you deleted that from your system, then you clone it once again.

50
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:07,160
I did it in this f drive this directory, same as previously I did in previous project.

51
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:09,820
You can clone it same place or do it somewhere else.

52
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,690
If you deleted it.

53
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,430
If you already have it, it's fine.

54
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:16,300
So let me clear the screen.

55
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,830
Once again, this is your repository that you created in continuous integration project, not mine.

56
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,100
So I will go to this directory.

57
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:28,150
Okay.

58
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,090
So we are in the main branch.

59
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:34,830
We will switch to CI hyphen jenkins.

60
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,870
So you need to be in this branch.

61
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,970
Sy hyphen Jenkins.

62
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,690
And then you switch.

63
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,190
On create, create and switch.

64
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:46,550
Sorry.

65
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:50,730
Git checkout and will secede hyphen Jenkins.

66
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:55,790
A new branch we are creating from the CI branch and we are switching to that branch.

67
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,900
And we'll copy the Docker files here.

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,280
So let's go.

69
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:03,970
It's a copy.

70
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,080
The Docker files.

71
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,260
And go to your repository where you have cloned it.

72
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:16,560
Make sure you already checked out to CCD.

73
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:18,670
Jenkins branch.

74
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:19,029
Okay.

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,220
And then you copy it.

76
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:23,590
So I'll say just paste it.

77
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Just control we.

78
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,680
So we will read the Docker files when we write the code.

79
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,480
For now, we're just preparing the source code.

80
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:35,740
So that's the first thing you need to do is copy the Docker file into your repository.

81
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,260
And it's there.

82
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,370
Okay.

83
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:42,400
Next thing is, you have to create two folders here.

84
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:49,470
Stage pipeline and prod pipeline.

85
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:52,730
Okay.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,280
Let's clear the screen.

87
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:04,950
And you copy this Jenkins file to stage pipeline and also to prod the pipeline.

88
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,230
I'm doing it from command line.

89
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:11,380
If you want, you can do it from the file Explorer also.

90
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:16,540
And we do not need this Jenkins file, which is in the root directory.

91
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:21,060
So I'm going to say git arm Jenkins file git item, not just our.

92
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,200
So better do it through command line.

93
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:24,580
Okay.

94
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,080
Now, why did I do this?

95
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:31,180
Well, for we will have two pipelines at the end of this project.

96
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,690
We'll have a staging pipeline and we'll have a production pipeline.

97
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:39,040
So a staging pipeline will use Jenkins file from staging pipeline directory.

98
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:44,050
And for production pipeline, we'll use Jenkins file from production pipeline directory.

99
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,210
And I think that's self explanatory.

100
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:47,000
Okay.

101
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,100
Now before we make the comment, code structure is ready.

102
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:56,050
By the way, we'll make the changes to the Jenkins file in upcoming lectures, but our structure is

103
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,590
ready.

104
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:04,810
And before I push it back to my git repository, I will validate this config file.

105
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:07,060
Just do a cat dot git config file.

106
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:13,690
Open this file, read this file and see jenkins branch mean it's going to merge it to see a jenkins

107
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:13,990
branch.

108
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,650
That is good.

109
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:22,690
If you see here anything like cursed branch Cecil Jenkins branch and you see merge it to see a Jenkins

110
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:29,530
branch if it's a different branch name here compared to here, then open this file and delete that entry.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,480
If you don't see it, it is good.

112
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,360
Now we'll say git add dot.

113
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:38,560
Whoops, let's take git add dot.

114
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:40,960
Get.

115
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,530
Commit hyphen m.

116
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:49,650
Let's say preparing see secede branch.

117
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,140
Okay.

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:57,130
Time to push, get push origin.

119
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:58,390
So we have a new branch, right?

120
00:06:58,390 --> 00:07:02,860
So we mentioned the origin ci seed hyphen Jenkins.

121
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:10,800
A new branch is created on the GitHub repository.

122
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:11,730
Let's go there.

123
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,320
Let's refresh.

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,270
We should see New Branch.

125
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,860
Cassidy Jenkins.

126
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah.

127
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:21,750
And we have the Docker file, we have these two directories.

128
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,500
They contain their own Jenkins file, which will be updating later.

129
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:26,350
Okay.

130
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:29,250
That's all we need to do really in this lecture.

131
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,370
If you want to do it with other ways, you can do that.

132
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:37,320
But you just need to have the Docker files from the profile repositories and these two directories with

133
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,670
their own Jenkins file.

134
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,550
So wrap this up and join me in the next lecture.
