1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:08,900
In this lecture, we will be creating an IAM user that Jenkins will use to access a s services like

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,060
ACR and X.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:18,210
Forced will create iam user second will create easier repository elastic container repository.

4
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,090
So let's go to iam service.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,700
I click on users.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:28,340
And see add users.

7
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:34,160
I will limit, as Sy said, Jenkins.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,190
Access key.

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,610
You can give whatever name you want for this user.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,990
Just make sure you put a checkmark and access key.

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,250
Next, attach existing policies directly.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,680
So we need to add here a few policy.

13
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,720
One is the EC two container registry.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,160
Full access, that one.

15
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,870
So this user can access the ACR repository.

16
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:02,080
The second one is going to be ex.

17
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,110
This is the service which will run our container.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,670
And Jenkins from Jenkins.

19
00:01:08,690 --> 00:01:09,590
It will be happening.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,370
So Jenkins will run.

21
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:16,340
It will be running a sea fly to deploy the container to easiest service.

22
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,890
So we need to give full access here.

23
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:20,780
Next.

24
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,250
Next.

25
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,740
Get once again, make sure these two policies are selected while creating this user.

26
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,780
Create user.

27
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:35,680
And I'm going to say download CSV file which will store which will have the credentials access key and

28
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,280
secret key.

29
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,500
We will need this in the next lecture.

30
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,360
I will keep this tab as it is so I can just copy it from here.

31
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,950
Also make sure you do not share this credentials with anybody.

32
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:51,040
Do not post these credentials in Q&A.

33
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,070
I have seen some people posting their credentials on Q&A.

34
00:01:54,100 --> 00:02:00,310
They will be instantly hacked by hackers or grabbed by the hackers and they'll misuse it.

35
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:08,320
So make sure you do not post your credentials on the Q&A or anywhere for that matter.

36
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:09,389
Okay.

37
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,200
Let's go to the next service.

38
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,400
Are.

39
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:16,610
Plastic Container Registry.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:21,170
So elastic container registry service is pretty simple.

41
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,920
It just stores your Docker images so you can store here.

42
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:27,560
You can make it public, you can make it private.

43
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,540
And just take a look, go through it, read it.

44
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,570
If you have never used ACR, it's pretty simple, but take a look.

45
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:37,090
Read this, understand what is ACR?

46
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,390
Like that.

47
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,440
There are many.

48
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,260
Not many, but quite few.

49
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,490
Repositories services available from Azure.

50
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,190
You have from Google, you have you have Docker Hub on Nexus.

51
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,010
Also, you can create a repository, Docker repository, your own local Docker repository, but will

52
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:56,030
be using ACR.

53
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,110
So let's say get started and we'll keep it private.

54
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,030
We don't want publicly accessible repository and repository name.

55
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,170
Let's give it a name.

56
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,210
Yeah, that is fine.

57
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:10,070
We profile app IMG.

58
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,540
That's the name I have given.

59
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,920
You can keep the same name, but make sure what you give.

60
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,460
You remember it because you're going to come here and copy this one.

61
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,660
Scroll down.

62
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:22,680
We're not going to do anything.

63
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,160
That's it.

64
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,200
Just give the name, create a repository.

65
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,280
It's that simple.

66
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,960
And this is the UI.

67
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,320
Okay.

68
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:31,880
I will come to this.

69
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:35,550
When we write our code, we need this URL.

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,670
So that is all in this lecture.

71
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:42,760
Join me in the next one where we set up Jenkins to run our Docker pipeline code.
