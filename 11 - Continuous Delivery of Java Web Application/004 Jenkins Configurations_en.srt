1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,450
In this lecture we will be doing multiple things on Jenkins.

2
00:00:05,689 --> 00:00:08,600
First install necessary plugins.

3
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,650
Second store enables credentials on it.

4
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:16,010
Third installing Docker engine in Jenkins.

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:21,410
So it's pretty simple things just go to Jenkins.

6
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,970
IP 80.

7
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,970
That's log in.

8
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:31,350
Okay.

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,640
We need to make sure this pipeline works because we will be extending this pipeline from continuous

10
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,690
integration to continuous delivery.

11
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:41,980
We'll come to this job, but first we have to install some plug ins.

12
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,230
So let's go to manage plugins.

13
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,160
Available.

14
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:48,870
Okay.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,320
One by one, starting with.

16
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,390
Docker pipeline.

17
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:57,540
Put a checkmark.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:06,950
Then darker build and publish cloud based Docker build and publish that one.

19
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:12,430
And we have ACR.

20
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,230
PCR, Amazon, ACR, this one.

21
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:23,080
And Pipeline.

22
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,420
Calling it steps that one.

23
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:29,210
Yeah.

24
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,910
You need to search it like that.

25
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,890
Pipeline, colon steps.

26
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:36,130
These are the four plugins we will use.

27
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,340
There's also one more plug in a plus credentials that gets installed as a dependency for this Amazon

28
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,710
Echo and the pipeline UW Steps plugin.

29
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,630
Okay, let's install this.

30
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:49,690
Okay.

31
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:56,010
Well, I don't see the credentials plugin getting installed as cloud V0 plus credential.

32
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,980
Let's wait for it to complete and then we'll check.

33
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,170
Okay.

34
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,920
This is install.

35
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,990
Let's go back to the top page.

36
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,009
Manage Jenkins, manage plugins.

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:09,639
Lets come again to manage plugins.

38
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:14,800
I want to see whether it has credentials plugin again.

39
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,880
Not able to search.

40
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,200
That means it's already installed.

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,820
We can check it in the install.

42
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:21,730
E.

43
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,180
S credentials.

44
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:28,190
A.W. Sdhc.

45
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,490
This is good and available SDK.

46
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:36,800
Okay.

47
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:38,130
I think it's already installed.

48
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:42,600
If it's not installed, we will not be able to find one option that will see now.

49
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,900
So go to manage.

50
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,330
Jenkins will store the access key and secret key in Jenkins.

51
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:51,520
So go to manage credentials.

52
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,620
This will be used by our pipeline.

53
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:00,860
Jenkins global credentials and see add credentials.

54
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,890
In the kind you should see credentials so that plug in card installed.

55
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,860
Select that and let's give a name.

56
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,380
I will say it is creds.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,030
ID and in the description also I'm giving same and I'll give the access key and secret key.

58
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,750
I have not closed this window so far, so copy the access key.

59
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:26,900
Be stood there.

60
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,810
And then the secret key.

61
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:31,460
Now you're going to see my secret key, which is very, very bad.

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:37,940
But anyways, I am going to delete this user once this recording is completed, so I don't mind you

63
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:38,780
seeing it.

64
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:43,580
Okay.

65
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,750
There.

66
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:45,700
Okay.

67
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,470
Please specify the secret access key.

68
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,670
That's what I did.

69
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:51,680
Okay.

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,950
What's going on here?

71
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,430
I see.

72
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,400
Yes, that's correct.

73
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:08,510
Mm hmm.

74
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:09,920
Okay, let's create it.

75
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,490
Let's see.

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,660
You're not saving it.

77
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:15,940
E.W. Scripps.

78
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,800
That's the credential name.

79
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,410
We will be using it in our pipeline code.

80
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:25,870
The next thing, the third thing is going through the command line and installing Docker engine.

81
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,410
So let's do an search to the Jenkins server.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,750
As a search hyphen, I downloads.

83
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,520
We profile high.

84
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,850
Pam That's my logging key one to at the rate IP address.

85
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,040
Yes.

86
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:48,980
Okay.

87
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,550
We're in.

88
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,230
Just be the root user.

89
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:54,400
So the hyphen.

90
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,960
I become the root user.

91
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:00,070
Run apt update person in person.

92
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,480
APT install a US client.

93
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,190
So that's what we'll install first.

94
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,370
And after this completes, we will install docker engine.

95
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,040
Okay.

96
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,230
By the time it is installing.

97
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,320
Let's go to Google.

98
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:26,230
And search for docker installation step on ubuntu docker install ubuntu go to the documentation docs

99
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:27,470
dot dot dot com.

100
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:28,660
Do not go anywhere.

101
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,340
These commands installation steps are changing a lot, many, many times.

102
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,980
That's why I have stopped putting them into the resource section.

103
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:39,520
So go to the documentation, find the steps and install it.

104
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:40,330
Okay.

105
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,740
So first is apt update.

106
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,580
We already did that.

107
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:44,920
So we're going to install these dependencies first.

108
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:45,970
Okay.

109
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,340
Make sure this is right.

110
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,780
1 to 20.

111
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,160
1 to 20.

112
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:51,150
Okay.

113
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,410
Okay.

114
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:55,690
Me.

115
00:05:55,750 --> 00:05:57,160
Clear the screen and shift.

116
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,600
Insert paste it.

117
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,820
Install these dependencies.

118
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:03,020
They're already installed.

119
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,710
Nice.

120
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:07,420
Okay to run these two commands.

121
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:09,220
One is creating this directory.

122
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:19,590
And next is downloading this GPG key for docker repository.

123
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:23,540
Okay.

124
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:30,230
Next is this big echo command, which is going to create the repository file.

125
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,450
Mm hmm.

126
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,290
Okay.

127
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,340
All right.

128
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,240
That's it.

129
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:40,700
APT update and install docker engine.

130
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,150
Yeah.

131
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:44,960
So I'm not telling you.

132
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,670
This is the command.

133
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,110
This is the command and this is the command because I don't know, it may change maybe in the next month.

134
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,730
Who knows?

135
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,460
So.

136
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:57,580
Make sure you go to the documentation, find the commands and install Docker engine.

137
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:04,800
Okay.

138
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,790
While this is installing.

139
00:07:05,790 --> 00:07:06,270
So.

140
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,180
Jenkins, we are going to write the code in the Jenkins to build the Docker image.

141
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:19,260
Docker image is built by Docker commands, so you need to have Docker engine installed in Jenkins so

142
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:23,160
Jenkins can run the Docker commands and build your Docker images.

143
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,640
And there is one problem though.

144
00:07:26,970 --> 00:07:33,690
Docker commands can be run only by the Docker, by the root user and the user who are in the Docker

145
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,200
group.

146
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:35,820
I'll show you what I mean.

147
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm going to switch to Jenkins user from here.

148
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:40,470
Yeah.

149
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:46,760
So I'm currently Jenkins user and I'm going to run the command docker images and you see I get this

150
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:48,440
error got permission denied.

151
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:49,790
Okay.

152
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:52,590
Exit from the route user.

153
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,940
You can obviously run the cow.

154
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,450
Any Docker.

155
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:54,890
Come on.

156
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,380
Right.

157
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,410
So what you have to do is you have to add user mode.

158
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,810
Hyphen A, capital G, you have to add.

159
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,930
Jenkins user in the Docker group.

160
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:08,070
So I say Docker.

161
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:14,790
Jenkins So Jenkins user will be added into the Docker group with this command and you can see it.

162
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:15,780
Jenkins.

163
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:19,300
See that it's in the docket group now.

164
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,820
Now, that is not it.

165
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:26,260
Either you restart the Jenkins service system, CTL restart.

166
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,370
Jenkins.

167
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,660
Ah.

168
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:30,430
You reboot Jenkins.

169
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:32,169
So I will say system.

170
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:32,919
It'll restart.

171
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:36,130
Jenkins But while running the build job.

172
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:42,340
Docker Build job if you are getting the same error in the Jenkins, then check whether this Jenkins

173
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:46,570
user is in the Docker group and if you see it's still there.

174
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:52,960
Then the next step I would suggest is just reboot Jenkins server because maybe the restart did not work,

175
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,700
so you might need to reboot it.

176
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:00,880
Okay, now final thing, it's time to test our continuous integration pipeline from the previous project.

177
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,970
It should be working because we are going to continue from here.

178
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,790
Yeah, I got logged out.

179
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:09,170
Uh huh.

180
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,720
I think it's still not ready, so it takes some time.

181
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:13,300
After restarting Jenkins.

182
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:14,560
Okay.

183
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,960
I have purposefully failed the pipeline.

184
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:21,670
If you remember from continuous integration project, I made a mistake so I get a notification, right?

185
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:27,130
So I'm going to go back to my repository here in the GitHub itself.

186
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:28,500
Yeah.

187
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,380
Not one.

188
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,380
And we are.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
We have used this branch.

190
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,100
See, hyphen Jenkins.

191
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:36,930
Mary.

192
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:38,460
We check the Jenkins file.

193
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:41,760
Yeah.

194
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,370
So I made this change, right?

195
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:45,640
So the pipeline fails.

196
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,500
I'm going to fix that.

197
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,610
I'm going to say edit.

198
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:56,410
And I will just remove that and replace it with the actual command and even and.

199
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,560
Let's.

200
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:01,830
Committed, fixed.

201
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
Maven.

202
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,980
Come on.

203
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:06,620
Com.

204
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,710
It changes.

205
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,710
Okay.

206
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,400
Now let's go back.

207
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,450
To our pipeline and it should automatically trigger it because there is a webhook.

208
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:22,980
Now we have also updated the webhook IP Jenkins IP.

209
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:23,220
Right.

210
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:25,080
So it should automatically trigger the pipeline.

211
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,280
It should complete it.

212
00:10:26,370 --> 00:10:29,310
If this is failing, make sure you fix the problems.

213
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:31,740
Make sure your next steps and so on are cube.

214
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,180
All are up and running.

215
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,470
Right.

216
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,490
Test the pipeline.

217
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,930
It should be a working pipeline.

218
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,950
So then only we can continue with the next lecture, we can continue with the project.

219
00:10:41,430 --> 00:10:44,070
So I'm going to pause the video and wait until this completes.

220
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:45,790
All right.

221
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:47,560
My pipeline completed successfully.

222
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,640
I made all the necessary changes.

223
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,560
Let's see.

224
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,630
In the next lecture, if we are able to build the Docker image and upload it to Amazon easier.

225
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,460
So wrap this up and join me in the next lecture.
