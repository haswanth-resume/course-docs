1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:04,320
Okay, so now you have a complete continuous integration pipeline.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,730
The next task will be to deploy our artifact to some environment.

3
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:14,580
So as discussed in this project, we are going to use beans tag as the target where we're going to host

4
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:15,320
our application.

5
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:17,160
It's also disposable environment.

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,620
If you want, you can use it for production also.

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:26,310
And we're going to have an ideas database instance for database if you're interested in active MQ and

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,100
rabbit MQ.

9
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:34,410
So you can include these two services also and elastic cache service and active MQ service.

10
00:00:34,650 --> 00:00:38,190
But even if you don't use, that's not going to stop you to do anything in this project.

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:45,420
So now let's go to Beanstalk service and create a beanstalk environment.

12
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,140
Just go to application.

13
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,150
Create application.

14
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,400
So we'll name it as a V profile hyphen app.

15
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:02,770
Scroll down.

16
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,390
Platform We will choose Platform Tomcat.

17
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,340
And first, we'll keep the sample code and then we'll make changes when we deploy.

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:19,550
Before we deploy the artifact, we're going to make some health checks changes also as we did in our

19
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,810
previous projects.

20
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,090
First capacity, we'll have load balanced instance.

21
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:32,390
So we have minimum two and maximum.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,710
We are saying it can scale to four.

23
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,150
And you can give the number as per your requirement.

24
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,560
And we'll keep everything else default here.

25
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:46,260
Keep your log in, Keep it.

26
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:52,920
So in case if you have to log in, then you can create a key pair and attach it before you create the

27
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,730
environment.

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,800
I'm going to use the same key pair, which I used for the C process.

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,480
See it.

30
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,870
And these are the only two changes I'm making right now.

31
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,910
And tags.

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,360
Let's kill some tag project.

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:16,800
We profile.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,960
Okay, let's create an app.

35
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:32,260
So this is going to take some time to create the stack by the time we'll go to the service.
