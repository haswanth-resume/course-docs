1
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:07,939
So let's see.

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:09,110
Create database.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,200
Standard.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:13,690
Will keep my SQL.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,050
We should make sure you are going with five or six.

6
00:00:21,930 --> 00:00:23,700
That's apt for our project.

7
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:29,040
We profile to keep it simple and under free tier, select this option.

8
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:31,470
Free tier so there is no chance of making any mistake.

9
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:33,420
So you will be in the free tier.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,760
Otherwise database can really get expensive.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:38,440
So limit us v profile c.

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:38,520
I.

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:38,820
C.

14
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,480
D.

15
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,770
I can project.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,110
My skull.

17
00:00:47,450 --> 00:00:48,710
Will keep that username.

18
00:00:48,710 --> 00:00:50,690
Will c auto generate password?

19
00:00:51,850 --> 00:00:55,030
So DBD to micro obviously because we selected free tier.

20
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,640
Single availability zone should be fine for our exercise project.

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,450
Exercise.

22
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:04,519
Additional connectivity information.

23
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:06,800
So it should be in the private network.

24
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,600
We are not exposing it to the public.

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:15,020
Security group will say create new so it creates a security group.

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,710
Will give some name to it.

27
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,860
We profile hyphen ci seed hyphen radius hyphen my SQL.

28
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,960
I find g.

29
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:29,050
It's quite a long name, but it will do will be easy to recognize.

30
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:34,500
Additional configuration, we need to create a database named accounts.

31
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:43,050
And once this is created, once this is up and running, we have to deploy the schemas also on this.

32
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:48,740
And I'm going to keep everything else default and let's say create database.

33
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,510
So you can change the parameters based on your requirement.

34
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,910
But for the project, this should be fine.

35
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,040
You credentials detail, and I'm going to store that into my sticky notes.

36
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,250
So let me copy that.

37
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,820
Be there.

38
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,780
So do you know when you generate credential?

39
00:02:08,789 --> 00:02:11,280
Do not refresh the page, otherwise you lose it.

40
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,900
Then you have to reset the password.

41
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:18,120
So once you create, it will generate the credentials and quickly copy it somewhere safe.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,780
A username, of course, admin.

43
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,850
And sometimes you'll also see the endpoint.
