1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,000
By now, we should have a security group for ideas and being stuck in environment created so we can

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:08,960
make changes.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,080
So let's go to S.E. to service.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,000
So instance security group ID, we have to get first.

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,780
Okay, so I have a few other instances.

6
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:23,740
You can ignore them.

7
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:25,370
Okay.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:27,580
This is the bean instance.

9
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,910
And it's a security group ID we have to get.

10
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,780
So that's the security group ID copy this being stacked.

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,880
Security group ID.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,700
Go to security group and find our IDs security group.

13
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,910
Their naming convention helps us.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,950
That's the security group.

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,100
So we have to add a rule here.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:02,420
It says 3306 from my IP, but since it's a private ideas instance anyways, we will not be able to access

17
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:08,450
it from our IP, but Beanstalk instance should be able to access this because our application on the

18
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:13,880
beanstalk will need to access the ideas which is going to be in the security group and we'll give the

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:19,100
description also like that allow the profile app to.

20
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:26,130
Connect radius on 83306.

21
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,140
DU proper description.

22
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,220
It will be very good when you come back after some time.

23
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,070
You know, you can easily understand why you have added this rule.

24
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:44,480
So this instance is in the state of backing up, but we should be able to connect to it.

25
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,060
So we're going to log into our beans tag instance, going to store beans, tag instance, and from there

26
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,470
we're going to log into radius.

27
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:53,330
So that will also perform a test.

28
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,460
And also we need to deploy the schemas.

29
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:00,620
So let's get the public IP of this beanstalk instance.

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:05,640
It will not be an ideal practice to log into Beanstalk instance and make changes.

31
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:13,650
So the good way will be you can launch a separate instance in the same VPC and then you can access ideas.

32
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,840
But for this project, this will do.

33
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,120
We don't have too many moving parts.

34
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,100
Okay, so copy the IP.

35
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,810
Let's do an SSH to it.

36
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,360
So the key that I have used ci hyphen v profile.

37
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:31,810
User is easy to hyphen user.

38
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:35,620
This is a Amazon Linux, so that will be the user.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,590
And the IP address.

40
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,400
So there will be one weird thing on the bean stack.

41
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,550
Easy, for instance, when actually very bad thing.

42
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,010
So security group will allow 22 from anywhere.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,690
That's not good.

44
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:59,520
But since, you know, it is made for the convenience of developers and testers so unnecessary they

45
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,910
don't need to know, make rule changes, port numbers, protocol.

46
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:03,420
Right.

47
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:08,100
So you know, they just made 22 from anywhere but make it safer.

48
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,860
Just say 22 from my IP.

49
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:13,410
Rule even though it will be disposable environment.

50
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,590
But there could be a lot of confidential information there in your instance.

51
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,070
Right.

52
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:19,710
So make sure you don't expose it.

53
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:24,810
So if you see from the beginning we are taking care of security group rule, we are not exposing things

54
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,560
totally.

55
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,420
And that's for your own safety, your project safety.

56
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:35,590
It will give you a little trouble, but it's all worth it.

57
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:40,690
So we did a search and we're in this beanstalk instance.

58
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,340
And from here we have to log into ideas.

59
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,480
So let's get the ideas endpoint.

60
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:55,970
And I'll also store it in my sticky notes so we can use it later also.

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:01,010
Okay, so we need my SQL client here.

62
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,190
So in the Beanstalk instance, I'm going to install my SQL client.

63
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:06,770
So yum, install my SQL.

64
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:13,550
And also we need Git because we're going to clone our source code where we have the SQL file.

65
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:15,330
We're going to get a SQL file from there.

66
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:17,990
We're going to run the SQL queries.

67
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:20,570
So we install both these tools.

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,560
Install.

69
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,350
So let's make a test first.

70
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,920
My SQL hyphen edge.

71
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,240
Let's put the endpoint.

72
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,330
I have a new admin hyphen p.

73
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,300
It's not recommended you put the password on the shell, but since you have already seen it.

74
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,320
And anyways, I'm going to delete that.

75
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,020
And also it's a private instance.

76
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:41,930
I don't mind.

77
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,160
But you should not put password like that on the shell.

78
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:46,680
Okay.

79
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,780
Be able to log in, show databases.

80
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:56,330
So if you are not able to log in from your beans tag instance to your IDs, then check your security

81
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,260
group rules.

82
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,410
Okay, now let's clone the source code.

83
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:06,910
So get clone.

84
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:14,010
And this was the reason I was telling, you know, you don't make changes to your beanstalk instance

85
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:16,320
because you download source code and do many things here.

86
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,790
Install softwares.

87
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:23,460
Okay, we will check out the branch CD Hyphenate SE.

88
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,660
And.

89
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,540
We will go to Z.

90
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,250
Mean resources.

91
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:42,620
We have DB backup SQL file and let's run this queries on our ideas from here.

92
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:49,410
So give the database name and put it addiction your SQL file pot.

93
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,310
And let's log in and check once again.

94
00:05:58,850 --> 00:05:59,990
Show.

95
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,280
We'll just say use accounts.

96
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:08,370
Show tables.

97
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:13,410
So you should see this schema, these three tables, and we're good.
