1
00:00:01,859 --> 00:00:03,980
So now the stage is set completely.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,820
Let's come to our code pipeline now.

3
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,280
Okay, So first let's go to our repository code.

4
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,210
Repository.

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,000
So we are using this branch sci hyphenate.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:20,730
So far we're going to use this branch KD hyphen eight.

7
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,390
CI hyphen branch.

8
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:30,760
We have updated the palm dot and settings dot XML file, but in this branch you have to make the changes

9
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,619
and you can do it from here itself.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,080
Let's create a duplicate tab.

11
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:38,610
In this staff.

12
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:41,850
We will be in ci hyphen a branch.

13
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,760
And we will open pubmed XML.

14
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,950
And it should have the entry of our code artifact repository.

15
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,490
Yeah.

16
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:55,440
Yeah.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,020
There.

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,700
So let's copy that.

19
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:03,490
Now be in kd hyphen ws branch open palm dot xml file.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,720
And edit so you can edit it from here itself, which is really cool.

21
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,200
I don't want to go back to my shell and do it again so you can make the repository changes over there.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:18,600
Yeah.

23
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,320
So, you know, you should have the code artifact repository URL there.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:26,510
Okay, let's give our name.

25
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,240
My name and email address.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,700
You can just fake some email address if you want.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,780
That's not really my email address of mine, actually.

28
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,570
So anyways, I just wanted to be in the commit, that's all.

29
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,830
That XML is updated.

30
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,780
Go to again another tab.

31
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:50,800
Make sure you see hyphen eight plus branch.

32
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,030
And open settings.

33
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,230
Dot xml file.

34
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:57,990
Okay.

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,580
And we need this entire file.

36
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,270
Copy this entire file.

37
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:05,890
And.

38
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,199
And make sure you're in the right branch.

39
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:09,400
Okay.

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:09,919
See, we have.

41
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:12,500
This is the branch that we are updating.

42
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,510
Settings dot xml file.

43
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,440
Edit.

44
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:24,370
So that before some, you know, fake or default entries in the previous file.

45
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:28,550
So I'm just overwriting it with the right entries.

46
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,310
Again skew the name.

47
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:34,050
Yeah.

48
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,860
Commit.

49
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,050
I should give some comment message.

50
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:42,950
But anyways, we are not really making any serious code change.

51
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:49,370
Now if you make any change to PSI hyphenate branch, remember your pipeline will get triggered.

52
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,960
That's also one more reason we're using a different branch.

53
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:02,020
So you're going to push the source code that we're going to give you, right to code repository and

54
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:06,400
you will see all the branches, you'll see CD hyphenate, any branch also, so you can just select it

55
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,570
and make the changes.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,170
So remember settings, dot XML and XML file.

57
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,600
We are giving these entries so our maven can download artifact from code artifact.

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:19,420
It can download it from that URL.
