1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,480
So people stage is set.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,950
We have been stacked environment and we have ideas, except we need to make a little health check on

3
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,080
our beanstalk environment if it's ready.

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:12,340
Okay, It's ready.

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,430
And I'm going to make a little change over here.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:21,130
Health check.

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,360
We're going to deploy our artifact on interactive.

8
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:26,420
Our application will be at slash logging.

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,670
So we need to make a health check there.

10
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,600
Slash login that you do.

11
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:48,470
And if you're planning to have HTTPS and all those stuff that we did in our project, you can do that

12
00:00:48,470 --> 00:00:48,810
as well.

13
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,740
But for this project, you don't need to do all those things.

14
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,920
This is going to be a disposable environment.

15
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,530
Let's apply these changes.

16
00:00:57,530 --> 00:01:00,560
When we apply these changes, this will go into a severe state.

17
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:04,890
But let's not worry about it.

18
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:08,270
Once we deploy our artifact, it will come back to normal state.
