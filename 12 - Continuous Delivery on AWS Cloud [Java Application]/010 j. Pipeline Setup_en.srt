1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:03,540
Now let's create a pipeline and put all these things together.

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:06,920
So let's go to Pipeline.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,370
You can edit the existing pipeline if you want and update the jobs over there.

4
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:16,930
Okay, so you can say edit.

5
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:21,510
And you can update the same pipeline if you want.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,870
But I'll create a separate pipeline for this.

7
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:29,450
Because the name is V Profile C Pipeline.

8
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:36,440
We can't edit that name, so we're going to create a separate pipeline, rename it as v profile hyphen

9
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:39,560
c c d hyphen pipeline.

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,100
So it's going to create a new role.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:47,790
Again, if you want to make it unique, just add a number there.

12
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:49,650
Now.

13
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,780
Let's go next.

14
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:54,640
Source provider code comment.

15
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,450
Our repository.

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,220
And the branch said hyphen.

17
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,340
E.

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:01,580
W.

19
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:02,190
S.

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:08,310
Let's keep cloud watch events to detect a new commit.

21
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,570
Next build.

22
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,560
Could build.

23
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:19,820
So first we'll select our build and release job, and then we'll update this pipeline and add all the

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,990
other jobs together.

25
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:23,660
Go next.

26
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,640
Deploy providers.

27
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,650
So Bienstock.

28
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:32,120
Application name and the environment name.

29
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,470
So as we already created our being stack environment and so in the same region.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,870
So it will also show the name and the environment name.

31
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:42,240
We can select that go next.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:44,800
Create pipeline.

33
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,300
As soon as I create the pipeline, I have to say stop execution right now.

34
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,310
Put some comment quickly.

35
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,030
Stop.

36
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,090
Already started disabled transition.

37
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,020
So already went.

38
00:02:05,110 --> 00:02:06,250
Okay, it's stopping.

39
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,080
Okay.

40
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,630
It's still in progress.

41
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,530
It's not stopping.

42
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:14,660
But I have disabled the transition to for the deployment.

43
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,720
I don't want it to deploy it right now.

44
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:22,600
So if it triggered automatically just to disable transmission and then you can transition and then you

45
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,520
can later enable the transmission.

46
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:25,770
Okay.

47
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:31,110
Now, instead of waiting for that job to stop, we will edit this pipeline and we'll stitch all the

48
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,220
jobs together now.

49
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:34,340
So let's go to edit.

50
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:38,650
So before we are building.

51
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:46,440
I would like to run a sonar analysis of code analysis stage.

52
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,540
At a new stage at the action.

53
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,970
It also is a code analysis.

54
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,870
Provider code build.

55
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,710
Input Artifact.

56
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:05,730
Source Artifact.

57
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,530
So download the source code.

58
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,970
Project Name.

59
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,640
So this is our project which is doing code analysis.

60
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,560
Any output artefact we want to give?

61
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,900
No, just done.

62
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,350
Okay.

63
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:20,970
After this.

64
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,960
Another job.

65
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:27,180
The previous job from our CI pipeline, which is going to build.

66
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,460
And store the artifacts.

67
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,640
So let's give that name and stage.

68
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,350
Add action.

69
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,650
We give the same name.

70
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:40,760
Provider could build.

71
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:44,390
Input Artifact Source Artifact.

72
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:46,640
Project name.

73
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,290
So this is the job the build job from was CI pipeline.

74
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,550
Let's select that.

75
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:00,220
Output artifact will give us build artifact.

76
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:05,380
So this is the name that we can select in the next job, which is going to deploy the artifact to S3

77
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:05,980
bucket.

78
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:09,190
That is also done.

79
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,430
And then add a stage to deploy the artifact to S3 bucket.

80
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,079
So let me just deploy 2x3.

81
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Add action deployed to three same name action provider.

82
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:29,340
Amazon is three.

83
00:04:31,170 --> 00:04:33,540
Input artifact as build artifact.

84
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:39,130
Bucket name, same as we selected in the CI pipeline.

85
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,770
We profile artifact storage extract before deploy.

86
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:47,760
And done.

87
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:49,610
Okay.

88
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,520
This job is also completed.

89
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,530
So let's check once again.

90
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:01,080
Fetch the source code, do code analysis then job to build and store.

91
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:03,390
And this is going to store to the S3 bucket.

92
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,120
Next, we have a build job.

93
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
So this job is going to deploy the artifact.

94
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:13,630
The next job will deploy the artifact to the bean stack.

95
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,560
Edit this job and build artifact.

96
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,380
Let's give a name.

97
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:20,040
Build artifact to be.

98
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:23,090
And say, Done here.

99
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,980
And that is going to deploy the artifact to the stack.

100
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:33,010
You have to edit this.

101
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:42,620
Hear input, artifact, build artifact to been.

102
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,460
So the previous job, which is generating the artifact, will be with this name.

103
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:50,000
So it's going to fetch that as an input artifact and deploy to Bienstock.

104
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,630
Okay, so let's say done.

105
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,460
This is done.

106
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,710
The last job is going to be running the software testing.

107
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,870
So let's add a stage.

108
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,250
Mm.

109
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,790
Software testing.

110
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,540
Let's copy that.

111
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:16,760
Add action.

112
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,130
Software testing action provider code build.

113
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:27,700
Input artifact is going to be the source code that we fetch.

114
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,950
And this one is going to fetch the Selenium Auto script branch.

115
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,590
Project name software testing.

116
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:39,750
This is the build job that we created already.

117
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,000
And that should be it.

118
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:46,840
Let's say dun dun.

119
00:06:48,370 --> 00:06:50,380
Steer clear of the naming convention.

120
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,100
Initially to go with.

121
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,920
You can use the same naming convention that I am using.

122
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,660
Then later, when you change and make sure you're referring it in the same in the pipeline.

123
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,120
So our pipeline is created.

124
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:05,570
Let's finally save this save.

125
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:10,860
Okay, let's check again.

126
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,540
So it's going to fetch the source code.

127
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,790
Branch city hyphenated US code analysis will run.

128
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:23,000
Build and store a build job which we will use to store the artifact.

129
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:26,420
Deployed to a store is going to store the artifact to the bucket.

130
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,400
One more build job.

131
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:34,810
Which will build the artifact so we can deploy it on Bean's tax or next job is to deploy two elastic

132
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:35,080
bins.

133
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:35,530
Tag.

134
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,490
And then finally, a software testing job.

135
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:43,110
This is also a code build job which is going to run our software testing.

136
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,570
Now it's time to test it finally.

137
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,900
So let's say release change.

138
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,480
Click on release.

139
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:01,660
And by the time this is happening, we'll also add our soon as notifications a new pipeline.

140
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,060
So we have to select the notification year also.

141
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:07,670
Not here.

142
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,880
Let's go to pipelines.

143
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,540
Let's select our pipeline.

144
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:19,790
Yeah, they are.

145
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:23,300
Notify manage notification rules.

146
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,330
Create notification rule.

147
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,500
So we'll see notification.

148
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:33,240
E.

149
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,539
W.

150
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:33,929
S.

151
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,419
C.

152
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:34,620
I.

153
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,220
C.

154
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:40,260
D pipeline hyphen notification.

155
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,120
Look if we profile.

156
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,050
Okay.

157
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,390
In detail notification.

158
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:54,060
We want a full notification and you can select all the all the events.

159
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,540
If you don't need any, just unselect them.

160
00:08:59,290 --> 00:08:59,920
Target.

161
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,630
So we already have a target.

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,720
V Profile Pipeline notification.

163
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,650
Submit.

164
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:12,790
Okay.

165
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:13,720
That's nice.

166
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,430
Let's check our pipeline.

167
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:16,420
What's happening?

168
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,100
We are in the code analysis job now.

169
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,940
We can see the progress.

170
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,210
We can see the details.

171
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,340
Phase details.

172
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,030
It's in a build stage.

173
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:31,490
Let's check the build logs.

174
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,130
It's downloading dependency and it should download from code artefact.

175
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:40,480
While it's already running Sonar scanner.

176
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,500
Scroll up.

177
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:42,980
Up.

178
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,170
Again your previous logs.

179
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,600
This is all coming from cloud watch.

180
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,780
So you can really go to cloud watch and you can see it from there also.

181
00:09:54,130 --> 00:09:54,330
Okay.

182
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,740
This usually hangs the browser.

183
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:00,750
Okay.

184
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,560
They're finally got it.

185
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:05,170
So, yes, it's downloading the artifact from code.

186
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:06,010
Artifact.

187
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,570
Let's close this.

188
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,700
This just keeps hanging the browser.

189
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,320
I'll go to phase details.

190
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,750
Okay.

191
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,670
It's going to take some time.

192
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:19,280
Let's go to our pipeline back.

193
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,580
Pipelines.

194
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,890
It's in progress.

195
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,310
So let's keep this view and it's going to take a longer time.

196
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:34,170
By the time I'm going to pause my screen and come back when it's done.

197
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:35,930
Okay.

198
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:40,570
We are at deploy to study that is completed successfully in the build job is running.

199
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:45,730
If you have disabled the transition, then make sure you enable the transition.

200
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:50,830
Otherwise the deployment job will not trigger and will not have a deployment on bienstock environment.

201
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,080
So make sure you enable the transition.
