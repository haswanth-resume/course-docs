1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:07,410
Okay, Now I'm going to create a separate build job, which is going to build the artifact for the deployment.

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,390
So let's go to build.

3
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:12,410
Build project.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,300
And we already have these two jobs here.

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,080
Also, we need to make some changes.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,620
We profile hyphen build.

7
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,910
This job is running code analysis.

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:27,310
We can check the build spec file.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,620
What it is doing.

10
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,740
And so it's running the sonar code analysis.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,860
So this will be also in our pipeline.

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:42,530
So we have to change the source code here also.

13
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:44,210
So edit source.

14
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:49,600
And change the branch from c hyphen to c.

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:49,750
D.

16
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:50,290
Hyphen.

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:50,470
A.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:50,720
W.

19
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:51,250
S.

20
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:52,020
C.

21
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:52,480
D.

22
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,020
And just update source.

23
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:05,500
Same for the other job as well, which is building our artifact or storing to store in the S3 bucket.

24
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,790
This job also makes sure you change the source code.

25
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:11,760
Branch.

26
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,820
Two seed hyphen.

27
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:13,950
E.

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,270
W.

29
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:14,820
S.

30
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,300
You can actually use sci fi blues branch also, but there are little changes in that XML file for this

31
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,420
particular project.

32
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:32,850
So if you're on CD Hyphenate Blues branch, you will not have any problem.

33
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:34,380
Okay.

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,480
Now we'll create one one more build project over here, which will build the artifact to deploy it on

35
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,320
bean stack.

36
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:48,920
You can edit the existing build project also, but I don't want you to disturb your existing jobs.

37
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,310
Which would be good for your revision also later.

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:59,420
Okay, so I'm going to name this job as V profile Build and release.

39
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,160
Build and release and we'll give a number over here.

40
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:10,940
We profile 14 just to make it unique, that's all, because it will create a role with this name.

41
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,440
So I want it to be unique.

42
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:15,290
Code commit repository v Profile.

43
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:16,130
Code repo.

44
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:17,870
And branch.

45
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,350
Yes.

46
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:18,740
Right.

47
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,580
CD hyphen.

48
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:19,700
E.

49
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:19,970
W.

50
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:20,540
S.

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:22,470
OC.

52
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:31,500
Operating System Open to Runtime Environment Standard Image 3.0.

53
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,370
Now, this will create a new role with this name.

54
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:44,340
Either we can do that and then but we have to then edit this role again so it can access some parameter

55
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,150
if you remember.

56
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,360
And instead of that, we can use our existing role.

57
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:51,340
So let's go to build project.

58
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,300
Existing build project.

59
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:57,540
Just showing you the easier way.

60
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,250
Right.

61
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,680
Edit environment.

62
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:05,350
And copy the roll.

63
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,460
This role.

64
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,490
We already updated with some parameter policy.

65
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:11,240
So.

66
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,960
This will be good and easier for us.

67
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,640
So let's give the role.

68
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:22,940
Now, sorry you have to say existing role and you give the role name and you select it over here.

69
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,210
The complete urn has to be given not just the role name.

70
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,370
So using existing role, the original configuration none.

71
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,380
We don't need this insert build commands switch to ed.

72
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:42,190
So the build spec file again, it's in our source code.

73
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:49,990
So either you can access it from GitHub or if you you must have already definitely signed it with this

74
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:51,280
repository as well.

75
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,120
So just switch to CD hyphen eight plus branch.

76
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,030
Go to files.

77
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:03,160
And there are these build spec files.

78
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,640
So build a release, build spec file this one.

79
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:12,100
So we have to define some parameters.

80
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,550
First thing is environment variable.

81
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,320
We are setting from parameter store.

82
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,870
So artifact token.

83
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:24,850
If you are getting authentication error while the build job is running, you have to generate this token

84
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,720
once again.

85
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:28,470
And then update the parameter.

86
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,600
You're going to update the IDs, endpoint radius, user and password.

87
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,840
These variables we're going to put into parameter store.

88
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,170
And then we can access it from here.

89
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:45,380
Installing JDK copying settings dot xml file to this location.

90
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,520
You already updated settings dot XML file and three set command.

91
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,350
Search and replace.

92
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:53,810
You're going to search for the database password.

93
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,850
And replace it with the password that we have.

94
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:06,420
Setting out parameter store and so application properties file we are changing with the password, with

95
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:08,550
the username and also the endpoint.

96
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:13,800
So before we build the artifact, we'll update application properties file.

97
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,190
Once that is updated, we install some tools.

98
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,090
JQ we download Maven, we create a link for Maven.

99
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,100
So these are pre-built commands.

100
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,280
And then finally, build command MV and clean install skip test.

101
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:32,530
Since we're running tests already on the sonar job.

102
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:36,600
So we don't want to run test over here artifacts.

103
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:38,130
Now, this is important here.

104
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,150
Artifact.

105
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,110
So base directory, we say this is going to be our base directory.

106
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,520
So it's going to do CD into that directory.

107
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,410
And this directly.

108
00:05:46,410 --> 00:05:47,820
We have our files.

109
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,650
So instead of uploading the entire artifact, like, instead of uploading the file, the artifact we

110
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:59,760
are uploading on the beans tag the content of this directory.

111
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,250
There are various ways to do it.

112
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,650
You can check the build spec documentation.

113
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,850
We're just saying all the content from this directory will be zipped and then upload it to the target.

114
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,060
So artifact really is in this bucket.

115
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,860
Sorry, in this directory.

116
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,520
So that's our build spec file.

117
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:22,590
So let's copy this.

118
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:30,540
And put it in your bill spec file here.

119
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,340
Okay.

120
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,120
Next.

121
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:37,750
Artifact.

122
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,480
If you want to upload the artifact to the bucket, we can do that.

123
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:44,770
But we're already uploading artifact from the previous job, so you don't need to do it here.

124
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:47,680
Log group name will give some log group name.

125
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:54,300
We'll say v profile hyphen ci cd hyphen logs, stream name.

126
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,300
We'll say build and release.

127
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,780
Good job.

128
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:03,940
All right.

129
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,320
That should be it.

130
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:07,210
And this job, let's create.

131
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,650
Okay, before we test it, we need to worry about the parameters.

132
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,100
We need to set this parameter in the parameter store.

133
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,190
Okay, First, let's generate the latest token.

134
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,090
And to do that, we can get the command here from code artifact.

135
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,230
Maven Central store.

136
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,600
We have connection instructions for Maven.

137
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,540
And that's the command.

138
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,330
Now, if you're following the project, well, you should already have a CLI and authentication configured

139
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:50,540
over here, so you can just put paste your command and get bash.

140
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:58,860
So it's it is going to run this command, get the token and we'll check the token.

141
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,000
It's there.

142
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:09,080
Let's copy this token and we will go to parameter stores and put these values over there.

143
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:14,260
Okay, let's search for the service systems manager.

144
00:08:18,670 --> 00:08:20,110
This is very important part.

145
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:26,000
The build job will need parameters If they are not able to find it, you're going to get errors.

146
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:32,179
So code artifact token, that's the parameter we stored and it's encrypted.

147
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,640
We can really see it because we have the key.

148
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,679
We're going to edit this.

149
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,809
And update the entry over here.

150
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:45,070
If you have just recently executed this pipeline.

151
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:46,750
So you don't need to update it.

152
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:53,500
But you know, after second day, third date one when the token expires, then you run this command,

153
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,680
get your token and update it over here.

154
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:02,370
Okay, a few more parameters you have to create for ideas.

155
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,990
Ideas, End point.

156
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:06,250
We have to create ideas, user ideas, path.

157
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,190
So let's create these three parameters.

158
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:11,870
Create parameter.

159
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:17,510
So make sure we have the exact same name adds hyphen endpoint.

160
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,850
I see it's normal string and the value.

161
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:28,210
So I already copied it in my note.

162
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,940
Sticky notes.

163
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,640
Create parameter.

164
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,930
Another parameter ideas user.

165
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,910
That's simple.

166
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,110
That is admin.

167
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,340
Just admin.

168
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:52,330
Create parameter.

169
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,670
Ideas pass.

170
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,210
So it's possible database password.

171
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,390
It has to be encrypted.

172
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,790
Should store it encrypted.

173
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:07,810
Secure string.

174
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,310
And the password.

175
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,380
Also, I have kept it out here.

176
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:19,920
Now, the encryption is not really for you because you are already seeing the video.

177
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,460
But when you do it in your project, right, it's important.

178
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,570
This will prevent the accidental exposure of your passwords.

179
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,000
So good.

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,210
We have given updated our token.

181
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:41,070
We've created three new entries over here which will be used by our build spec file code build job.

182
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,780
So this job build and release job.

183
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,690
When we run.

184
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:52,550
So build spec file is going to access parameter store.

185
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,160
Right and use these variables.

186
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:59,590
Can use this variable and assign the value from parameters to night.

187
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,520
And those variables we're using here.

188
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:06,120
To update our application properties file.

189
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,360
Okay.

190
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:10,680
This should be good.

191
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,290
We can test this job.

192
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,700
Just start build.

193
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:23,330
So this is really not going to give us any great result, but we can just test whether it's working

194
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:23,750
or not.

195
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,430
Once we connect it in the pipeline, then only this job will make some sense.
