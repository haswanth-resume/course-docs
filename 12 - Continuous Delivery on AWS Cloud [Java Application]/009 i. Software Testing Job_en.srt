1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:00,600
Okay.

2
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:04,980
While this is happening, we'll create another job, which will be for our software testing.

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,640
And for this, you need endpoints also.

4
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,050
So endpoints have been stacked.

5
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:13,640
So let's get started.

6
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:21,980
Let's create the job and we will name it as software testing.

7
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,620
So could commit.

8
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,640
Our source code repository there.

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:32,800
And branch.

10
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,810
Will be Selenium Auto scripts.

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,680
So this branch will have our Selenium automation scripts.

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:47,660
And image.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,820
This has to be executed on a Windows machine.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,610
So we are going to select Windows Server 2019.

15
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,400
Runtime base.

16
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,750
Image.

17
00:00:57,410 --> 00:00:59,030
So only one option you have.

18
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,290
Let's go.

19
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:00,950
Next.

20
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,230
Again, we'll be using existing role.

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,150
So let's get our real name.

22
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:12,520
So build project or CI build project.

23
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,720
Check the environment.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,410
And you should have the rule name.

25
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,870
Existing real estate and just select it.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,870
I always recommend you give some unique number because when you're practicing, it will create role.

27
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,950
And then when you create the job with similar name, the role will be already existing.

28
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,010
So there will be a conflict when you say new service role.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,170
So give a number some unique numbers so it creates a unique role name.

30
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,060
Okay, that's it.

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,720
Here.

32
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,730
Insert, build, command.

33
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,530
The switch to Ed and we have a separate build spec file for our Windows machine, which is going to

34
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,120
run our selenium test suit.

35
00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,010
So let's go to a repository.

36
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,610
Source code.

37
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,510
Repository.

38
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:04,780
Again.

39
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,070
N.

40
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,100
KD hyphen.

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:06,250
E.

42
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,520
W.

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,450
S branch.

44
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,600
It finds.

45
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,400
When bill spect women.

46
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:18,160
So let's understand this build spec file.

47
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,020
So we just have series of commands over here.

48
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
First it's going to set up chocolaty.

49
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,920
Then you can use cocoa, install JDK eight.

50
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,890
So go install MAVEN show, go install Google Chrome.

51
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:30,790
We'll need Google Chrome.

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,850
So we'll install that git.

53
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:38,290
And we create a directory here output directory where the output screenshot will be stored.

54
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,520
And then we have start sleep 360 seconds.

55
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:48,090
So we're going to halt the execution for 3/62 before we run the selenium test suit.

56
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:54,400
Because once the deployment happens, this job will get triggered.

57
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:59,950
And OpenStack, if you have multiple instances and it's going to take time for the deployment.

58
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,100
All right.

59
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:06,410
So that's why we are waiting for 360 seconds before the deployment completes.

60
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:10,290
And if that is less, we can even increase that time.

61
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:14,330
Or I'll just go with 500 seconds.

62
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:16,790
Now, I updated that in the build spec file when I add.

63
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,500
Okay, So it's going to run a clean test.

64
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,230
And we are passing parameter.

65
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,280
This URL will be checked.

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:32,060
So we have to update the URL and username and the password and the location where it is going to store

67
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,080
the screenshot.

68
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,260
So let's copy this file.

69
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:42,840
Select all.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:43,680
Be seated.

71
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:46,500
Make sure there are no errors.

72
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:49,980
If there is any YAML syntax error, it will highlight.

73
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,340
Sometimes everything will seem fine, but you will see an error that this is not recommended here.

74
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,980
There could be an invisible invisible characters.

75
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,730
So if such case happens, you know, just if it's showing over here.

76
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:05,720
So just do it like this is go backspace.

77
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,140
So it's going to eliminate all the invisible special character.

78
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,620
Okay, so once we run the suit.

79
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,740
It's going to generate the output.

80
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:19,500
And we are saying all the output that is generated is our artifact.

81
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:21,890
We're going to upload all that to S3 bucket.

82
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,990
So we'll also need an S3 bucket for this.

83
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,700
So let's go to S3.

84
00:04:35,620 --> 00:04:37,060
And let's create a bucket.

85
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:38,990
Mm.

86
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:42,560
V pro file secede.

87
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,170
Test output.

88
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:51,980
And just to make it unique, let's put some number like 56.

89
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,790
Make sure it's in the same region where you're creating your pipeline.

90
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,250
So mine is in not Virginia.

91
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,370
So I have selected North Virginia here to create.

92
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,850
Look, you come back to your code belt job.

93
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,780
Artifacts.

94
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,800
Now, here we're going to select three and we'll select our bucket name.

95
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:18,480
And it's not showing the bucket name and there is no refresh button also here.

96
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:22,430
So if you create the bucket while creating the job, it will not update.

97
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:26,000
So we have to cancel this job and create it again.

98
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,590
No problem.

99
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,150
We can create it very quickly.

100
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:39,550
Images, software testing.

101
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,420
Could commit as the source.

102
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,360
Repository.

103
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:49,880
Branch.

104
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,400
Selenium Auto scripts.

105
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:02,370
Operating system, Windows Server 2019 Runtime base and the default image.

106
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:06,350
Existing role.

107
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,230
So let's go to our code build.

108
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,530
From the build project.

109
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:15,640
Copy the rule name.

110
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:19,640
Paste it over here and select that.

111
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,260
Okay, let's scroll down.

112
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:24,910
Insert, build commands.

113
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,680
Switch to editor.

114
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:30,240
And copy.

115
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:36,820
Our win underscore bid spectrum will file select all based.

116
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,900
Make sure there are no indentation error.

117
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,510
And now we should see our S3 bucket.

118
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,210
We profile CCD test output 56.

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:58,300
If you want to create a subfolder inside that, you can mention that or enable semantic versioning.

120
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:03,250
So if you have given versioning, then you have different versions of the artifact.

121
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:06,660
We'll see.

122
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,530
Zip it.

123
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,660
So in the bucket, we'll have a zipped artifact.

124
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,380
Log group name.

125
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,150
So I'll give the same group name that we used for our.

126
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,640
Build and release job.

127
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,840
So the job logs.

128
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:44,880
That's not mandatory, but it's good to have all our log for our project in one place.

129
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,370
So use the same log group name.

130
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,920
And see software.

131
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:03,340
Give some nice name and say create, build project.

132
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,080
Okay, So another job is also ready.

133
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,650
All right, so we have our V profile build job that runs the core analysis.

134
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:19,840
We profile build artifact that that builds the artifact and stores in the S3 bucket.

135
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,180
Build and release job that's going to generate the artifact for the deploying to deploy on Bienstock

136
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:29,660
software testing job that is going to run the software test suit.
