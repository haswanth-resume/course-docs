1
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:07,680
Now we will launch easy two instances with user data.

2
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,130
We'll have some batch script to provision our services.

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,850
So let's go to EC2 instances.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,620
Instance section.

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,520
Let's foresee the user user data script that we'll be using for provisioning our EC two instances.

6
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,640
User data script is in our source code, so you can clone the source code.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:32,220
If you already have it, you can just do get pull.

8
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:44,370
Okay.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:58,620
Let's get into a repository and we are going to shift to a branch named S hyphen lift and shift shift.

10
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,100
Okay, let's clear the screen.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:14,290
You have a user data directory over here and you will see some bunch of shell scripts.

12
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:20,530
These are the same shell scripts that we used in our previous project when we provision our instances

13
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:21,430
with Vagrant.

14
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:30,040
So first we'll provision our backend services, rabbit, MQ, Mem cache and MySQL.

15
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:34,120
Let's see these scripts through our sublime text editor.

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:50,540
So force will provision my SQL.

17
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:53,330
So it's the same script that we used in previous project.

18
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:59,320
We are installing dependencies and my web server.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,840
But my SQL will be running on CentOS seven instance.

20
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,930
So we're installing my my DB hyphen server package.

21
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,440
We start n enable it, we clone the source code and then we initialize our database.

22
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:21,520
We do some security changes and we create database named accounts.

23
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:26,350
We create a user admin with password admin.

24
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:26,970
One, two, three.

25
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:31,810
You can change the password if you want, but then make sure you make changes to application properties

26
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:32,410
file.

27
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,180
And we of course initialize our database with schemas.

28
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,330
And then finally we restart my service and we take care of our firewall rule.

29
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,540
So we'll have firewalls, a two level one, the security group, the second and the operating system.

30
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:58,470
So let's provision a MySQL easy to instance with this user data script first.

31
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,380
Okay, so let's go to instances launch instance.

32
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,790
We will give a name.

33
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,380
We profile.

34
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,740
Hyphen db zero one will add one more tag.

35
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,930
We'll say add tag.

36
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,280
Project.

37
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:21,830
The profile.

38
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,010
Let's come down.

39
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,460
Now we need Center seven instance for this.

40
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:32,860
So we need to click on Browse more Amis and go to a marketplace.

41
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
Make sure you click on it.

42
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:41,880
Marketplace and Type CentOS seven.

43
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,100
Find your Amy Center seven.

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,880
That one.

45
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,320
Let's select that.

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,350
Let's click on continue here.

47
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:59,610
Okay, so am I selected instance type tw to micro should be fine for this one.

48
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:04,830
Let's select the key pair v profile prod key that we created earlier.

49
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,380
This will be used to log into our instance.

50
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,940
In network settings, select existing security group, and we will select the security group that we

51
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:14,990
already created.

52
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,149
The profile backend SG database goes in the back end security group.

53
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,300
Advance details.

54
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:30,220
Scroll down and we need to add the user data script here.

55
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,830
So let's get our user data script.

56
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,750
So I'm going to copy all this.

57
00:04:35,770 --> 00:04:37,810
Make sure you select everything.

58
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,090
Do not miss the beginning.

59
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,160
And let's face it here.

60
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,190
And let's click on launch instance.

61
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:54,110
It is successfully launched.

62
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:56,000
Instance, let's click on the instance ID.

63
00:04:57,010 --> 00:04:58,300
And that's our instance.

64
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,710
It is in pending state.

65
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:03,400
And even if it's in a running state, it is going to take some time.

66
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,440
To come stable because it will be executing the user data script, which will kick in in a few seconds.

67
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,740
So after a few minutes I will try to log into this instance.

68
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,120
We need to go to the security group.

69
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:20,490
We're going to do SSH to this AC instance.

70
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:21,810
And we need to allow.

71
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:26,190
Port 22.

72
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:28,140
Or we can just select search from here.

73
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:35,070
Or we can just say for 22 from my IP so I can do a search to this instance, which is in the security

74
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:35,610
group.

75
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,180
So I'll take its public IP.

76
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,580
I will open my kid bash.

77
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:50,130
I have the key downloaded in the downloads directory.

78
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,490
And we have the user center's center seven instance.

79
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,470
Get the IP address.

80
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:03,510
Log in.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,720
And we are in that's login is the root user.

82
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,700
Let's clear the screen.

83
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:16,370
If you want to see user data from here, you can do cool.

84
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,580
And you can use this URL.

85
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,060
So it will show you the user data script.

86
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,910
Let's check if it has provisioned.

87
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:37,520
Over my SQL Service system.

88
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,830
CTL Status Manager DB.

89
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,860
The service is still not up and running.

90
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:55,330
It could be because it's already provisioning the services.

91
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:57,220
It's already executing our commands.

92
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,330
Let's check the process.

93
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:06,940
And if you see the process, which is installing my server now.

94
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,350
So it's going to take a minute.

95
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:10,870
Let's pause the video for some time.

96
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,700
Okay, So after waiting five, 10 minutes more.

97
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,400
Let's check.

98
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,070
Let's log in now.

99
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,900
Let's check the service, first of all.

100
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,490
System serial status.

101
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,330
Maria DB And the service is active.

102
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,910
Let's log into the DB, my SQL hyphen, u root and the password.

103
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,420
Okay.

104
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:42,180
Let's check the databases.

105
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:43,770
The database is created.

106
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:46,530
This accounts database we have.

107
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,050
Let's use it.

108
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:50,430
Sort.

109
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,380
Use it.

110
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,310
Use accounts.

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,040
Show tables.

112
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,470
All right, This is good.

113
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,090
Let's exit from here.

114
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:07,000
So we have successfully provisioned our MySQL easy to instance with user data.

115
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:11,290
Now it's time to provision our other backend services.

116
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:14,910
Next will provision mem cache.

117
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,180
Jim, Come on.

118
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,940
So we'll be using Center seven easy instance.

119
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,510
So let's launch an instance.

120
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:29,620
Name tag v Profile hyphen MK zero one.

121
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:31,850
Additional tag.

122
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,970
Same project we profile.

123
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:39,200
Let's go to Marketplace.

124
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:43,919
And find CentOS seven.

125
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,230
Center seven select.

126
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,270
Continue.

127
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:59,200
Instance type again to micro is fine using the login key.

128
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,930
We profile Iraqi.

129
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:06,370
Network settings Select existing Security group.

130
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,600
We profile backend security group member cash also goes in back and security group.

131
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,410
Advance details.

132
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:18,030
Scroll down.

133
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,680
User Data.

134
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,660
Let's take our user data script.

135
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,640
And be stood here.

136
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,770
And launch instance.

137
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:34,380
Click on the instance ID.

138
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,690
It's in pending state.

139
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,380
It's going to come up in some time.

140
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:39,190
Okay.

141
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:45,010
Now, instead of waiting for this instance to be provisioned completely, we will also provision Robert.

142
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,860
Q And then we'll verify both.

143
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:52,300
So let's check the user data for Rabbit MQ.

144
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,700
Which is again installing dependency.

145
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:08,240
Downloading rabbit MQ rpm, downloading its key, installing rabbit MQ rpm start and enable rabbit MQ

146
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,000
service.

147
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,880
Make some configuration change.

148
00:10:11,890 --> 00:10:19,930
Add rabbit MQ user called test with passport test and set it administrator tag and then finally restart

149
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:21,310
rapid MQ service.

150
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:25,430
Okay, so let's go to console.

151
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:28,020
Launch instances.

152
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:37,140
See, we think tag we profile hyphen or q01 additional tag project.

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,400
We profile.

154
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,040
Let's find the center seven.

155
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:42,770
EMI.

156
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:45,700
Marketplace.

157
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,450
Center seven.

158
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,910
Select.

159
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:56,360
Continue.

160
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:02,810
Instance type once again t to micro key pair.

161
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:05,150
Same key V profile prod key.

162
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:11,780
Select existing security group and rabbit MQ also goes in the back end security group.

163
00:11:15,770 --> 00:11:17,180
Advance details.

164
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:18,860
Scroll down.

165
00:11:19,890 --> 00:11:22,050
And let's get our rabbit Q script.

166
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,430
And pasted there.

167
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:31,250
Launch instance.

168
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,130
Let's click on View All instances.

169
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:40,620
You need to sometime refresh this page.

170
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,570
Click on this refresh button.

171
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:48,360
Now, we'll wait for some time and I'm going to pause my screen and come back when the provisioning

172
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,440
is completed.

173
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,820
I am back from my coffee break and now I will validate these two instances.

174
00:11:58,280 --> 00:12:00,410
So let's access Metcash first.

175
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,510
We are in.

176
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,580
Let's become the route user.

177
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:29,250
Let's validate the user data.

178
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,720
So cash service should be up and running.

179
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:38,760
Let's validate that cash to.

180
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,310
And it's running.

181
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:53,320
It's also check if it's running on right board.

182
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,770
This is good.

183
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,350
Let's exit from here.

184
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,660
Let's also check rabbit MQ.

185
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,260
We are in.

186
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:42,580
Let's check the user data script.

187
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:51,020
Let's see the status of rabbit MQ server.

188
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:53,740
And it's up and running.

189
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,200
So our back and stack is up and running.

190
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,470
Rabbit MQ mem cache and database.

191
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:10,170
The next thing is we will update private IP of these three instances in Route 53 private DNS zones.

192
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,490
Let's narrow down their IP addresses.

193
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,830
Let's copy DB zero one private IP.

194
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:28,560
Mukesh Cash.

195
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,020
Robert MQ.

196
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:46,120
Okay.

197
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:52,110
Now let's go to Route 53, service, Route 53.

198
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,580
And here we create a hosted zone.

199
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,670
This will be private.

200
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,500
So we can give any domain name.

201
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,770
Let's give a V profile dot in.

202
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:16,380
Let's give some description.

203
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,660
Let's select the region.

204
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,460
North Virginia.

205
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,590
Their US East one.

206
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,910
Select the default VPC.

207
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:55,970
And see create holstered zone.

208
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,290
So Hostess zone is created.

209
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,390
Let's create records now.

210
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,710
Create record.

211
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,890
Simple routing.

212
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:09,610
Next.

213
00:16:11,030 --> 00:16:12,650
Define simple record.

214
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,770
So forced.

215
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,430
DB zero one.

216
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:20,270
Point.

217
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,380
An IP address.

218
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,410
And let's give the IP address.

219
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,550
Define.

220
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:36,870
One more.

221
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:42,670
Endpoint will be an IP address again.

222
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,180
Define simple record.

223
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,740
Robert McHugh.

224
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,740
So we defined the record, let's say create records now.

225
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:24,420
So it's a simple area code name to IP mapping.

226
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,180
Which will be used by our Tomcat.

227
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:34,660
AC For instance, in our application properties file, we will mention these names rather than mentioning

228
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,920
IP addresses.

229
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:41,940
So even if we replace the backend servers and we we give the same name.

230
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:47,220
Then we really don't need to make any change in our application server.

231
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,690
Okay, let's launch.

232
00:17:52,390 --> 00:17:52,570
What?

233
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:54,280
Don't get easy to instance now.

234
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,990
So user data script we have.

235
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,270
This one which is for centaurus.

236
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:13,950
And we also have tomcat underscore ubuntu dot search, which is very very simple because in open repository

237
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,480
we can directly install tomcat eight by using apt installed tomcat eight.

238
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:25,850
And anyways, we are building the source code locally in our laptop and then we're going to push the

239
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,780
artifact to the Tomcat instance through S3 bucket.

240
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:35,240
So this is a much simpler approach and we will use 1 to 18 I for that.

241
00:18:37,770 --> 00:18:38,430
Let's see.

242
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,690
Launch instance.

243
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,890
Dag we profile hyphen app.

244
00:18:44,910 --> 00:18:45,900
Zero one.

245
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:47,790
Additional tag.

246
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,110
Project we profile and we will need ubuntu 18 for this one.

247
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:56,830
Ubuntu 18 I say.

248
00:18:56,850 --> 00:18:58,560
So let's click on ubuntu here.

249
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:02,120
And we'll go for open to.

250
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:04,600
18.

251
00:19:05,790 --> 00:19:09,870
Now, as per a user data script, we are using Tomcat eight.

252
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:19,930
If you go for open to 18, open to 20 or higher, then you need to install Tomcat nine so you can switch

253
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,140
it to Tomcat nine or better.

254
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,070
Just keep open to 18 and use the same user data script.

255
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:29,340
So once again, Tomcat 801 to 18.

256
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:30,770
Okay.

257
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,460
One moment.

258
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:35,920
I selected the wrong army.

259
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,010
I have to go with this one.

260
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:38,460
Open to server 18.

261
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:43,830
Not the deep learning open to server 18 SSD volume type.

262
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:48,630
Let's come down to to micro will keep it login key same.

263
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:52,120
Security group.

264
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,660
Now, this is not going to go in back end.

265
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:58,810
This will be in V Profile App Security Group.

266
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:03,510
And this allows port 88 from the load balancer.

267
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:06,540
So this will be connected to the load balancer.

268
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:08,980
Advance details.

269
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,530
Let's come down.

270
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,270
Let's get our script.

271
00:20:16,410 --> 00:20:19,470
We stood there and say, Launch instance.

272
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:25,120
Click on View all instances.

273
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,470
And refresh this.

274
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,980
So this is in pending state.

275
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,570
It will come in running state and then it will provisional script.

276
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:37,700
So that is all in this video.

277
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:45,200
In the next video, we will see how to build the artifact on our laptop and deploy it to the Tomcat

278
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,750
server.

279
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:46,820
We have zero one.

280
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:52,310
So launch all these instances, wait for a few minutes and join me in the next lecture.
