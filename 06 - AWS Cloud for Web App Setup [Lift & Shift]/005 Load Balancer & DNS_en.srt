1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,490
Your application server is also up and running back and services are up and running.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,230
Now it's time to set up a load balancer.

3
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,170
So let's go to S.E. to.

4
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:16,900
And we'll go to load balancers.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,750
We are going to create application load balancer.

6
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,850
So first we need to create a target group.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,930
So let's go to target groups and create a target group.

8
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,830
For instance, we're going to add, etc. instance, you name the target group V profile app hyphen,

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:42,430
the G Port 8080 Tomcat running on Port 88 and see VPC.

10
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:45,280
The health check will be slash log in.

11
00:00:47,310 --> 00:00:48,620
Advanced health check.

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,880
So for health check, also, we have to override the port 8080.

13
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:56,450
Healthy threshold.

14
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:59,900
Let's reduce it to two or three.

15
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,000
Available.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,830
Instance select.

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,550
Our application server Tomcat.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,900
And say include a spending below.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,240
And they create target group.

20
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,920
Target group is created.

21
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:24,720
Let's go to load balancers.

22
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:27,570
Let's click on Create Load Balancer.

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,230
And we will be selecting application load balancer.

24
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:34,850
That's what we need for HTTP and HTTPS traffic.

25
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:36,770
Let's say create.

26
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,710
Load balancer name v profile fraud ill be internet facing because we want to expose it on the internet.

27
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,410
Zones.

28
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,140
We have to select all the zones here.

29
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:56,430
Now this will make your load balancer also highly available.

30
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,860
So minimum two availability zones you have to select for high availability.

31
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,200
So if you're not going to select all the zones, you have to make sure you select at least two.

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,080
And out of that two, one should be the same availability zone where you have your Tomcat, AC, for

33
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:21,920
instance.

34
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,650
Or else just select all of them.

35
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,370
Security group.

36
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:30,480
We will be selecting the load balancer security group that we created earlier.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:35,310
And it can allow traffic on 84 for three from anywhere.

38
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:38,170
Listener.

39
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,720
So our intention is to have a DPS listener.

40
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:43,960
We'll say add listener.

41
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,850
We will select here as DPS.

42
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,510
And we'll keep it for four three and we'll select the target group.

43
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,470
But also let's keep 84 now for validation.

44
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:58,330
Later we can remove this.

45
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:03,950
So eight and four for three, both forwarding the traffic to the same target group.

46
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:09,750
Now when you select here HTTPS, you have to mention the certificate.

47
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,410
So we already created certificate in the prerequisites ACM certificate.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,570
You have to select that certificate here.

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:24,410
If your certificate does not appear over here, make sure you are in the right region and your certificate

50
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,550
is validated.

51
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:28,850
If you have any further doubts on certificates, check the prerequisites.

52
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,730
Video where we created the certificate.

53
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:34,810
Okay.

54
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,860
I think this is all.

55
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,250
Let's click on Create Load Balancer.

56
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,910
View load balancer.

57
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:46,080
So it's in provisioning state.

58
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,730
It will come up in some time.

59
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,430
By the time we will take its end point.

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,870
We copy it from here.

61
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,480
Description.

62
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,470
This is better.

63
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:05,590
It's copy the endpoint of this load balancer and we'll go to our domain provider.

64
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,230
I have GoDaddy domain groovy dot n and I will add a C name record here.

65
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,860
Select C name Record host.

66
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,959
We will give V profile.

67
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,280
App and we'll see it points to this endpoint.

68
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,080
So you see.

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,810
So we profile app dot goofy dot in will be our URL with https of course.

70
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,160
So it's still in the provisioning state.

71
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

72
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:46,200
In a few minutes, it became active.

73
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:54,570
And now let's validate http s slash slash V profile app dot.

74
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,950
Graphy dot in.

75
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,290
And that is pointing to the end point.

76
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,890
Of the load balancer and load balancer has routed the request to Tomcat.

77
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,810
This page is coming from Tomcat.

78
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,590
Let's log in admin, underscore VPI password admin.

79
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:17,850
Underscore VPI.

80
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,950
Successful login.

81
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:27,240
That means my SQL Server connection is there.

82
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:31,440
Let's check rabbit and queue whilst generating queue.

83
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:32,400
Go back.

84
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Let's check Mom cash.

85
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,550
Click on all users.

86
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:39,330
Let's select a user.

87
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,850
The data is inserted in cash.

88
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,830
Nice.

89
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:52,060
Yeah.

90
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,000
Now, the data is from cash.

91
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:55,720
Yeah.

92
00:05:57,730 --> 00:06:04,300
And that was a successful set up of our application workload on cloud.
