1
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,270
We will validate application server after some time.

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,170
By the time we'll build our artifact.

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,220
And we'll build it locally on our laptop.

4
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,710
And for this we need to install some tool.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,130
We need JDC and MAVEN to be installed in our computer.

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,900
So if you have Windows machine you can use chocolaty to install JDK eight and Maven.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,680
If you have macOS, you can use blue cask.

8
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:32,369
I will open my PowerShell.

9
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:39,880
Open as administrator.

10
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:43,210
So we need to install GDG and MAVEN.

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,330
If you follow the prerequisites video, you would have already installed it.

12
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:50,140
You can check MV and hyphen version.

13
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:54,260
You can check java hyphen version.

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:01:03,490
So if you see here in MAVEN version, if you see Java version higher than 1.8, then you have to uninstall

15
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:08,290
Maven and uninstall JDK and then you install it again.

16
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:13,270
Choko on install Maven.

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:20,460
You run that command and then you run JDK eight hyphen y.

18
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,010
If you see a Java version, which is not same as 1.8 here.

19
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:28,180
But if you already see this, this is good.

20
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:33,540
And if you have uninstalled it or if you have not installed it, just say again.

21
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,590
Kyoko install JDK eight iPhone VI.

22
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,600
First adjudicate you have to install.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,790
And then Joko install.

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,060
Maven.

25
00:01:49,180 --> 00:01:55,300
So if you have uninstalled it or if you don't see Maven and JDK, then you can use Choco Command.

26
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,420
For macOS user, you can use Blue Command.

27
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,020
Okay, so we have the dependency.

28
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,070
Time to build our artifact.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,120
Let's go to our repository.

30
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:18,190
And let's go to CRC Main Resources.

31
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,690
And we should have application properties file here.

32
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,730
We will update this file.

33
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:31,770
So we have DB zero one the host name of database.

34
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:36,810
It is db 01. v profile dot in.

35
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:37,320
Now.

36
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:55,950
As per our route 50 3dna Zones Entries mc01 dot v profile dot n and Rabbit m q dot v profile dot n.

37
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,440
All the other things are common.

38
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:10,360
3306 Port four Database Username password 11211.4 mem cash 5672.4 Rabbit MQ test username and tested

39
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,170
database.

40
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:16,330
If you made any change to the user data script while provisioning, you have to make changes over here

41
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:16,990
as well.

42
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:20,220
So let's see.

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,970
Even quit.

44
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,400
Let's clear the screen.

45
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:49,740
So in a Route 53 state zone, let's validate it once again.

46
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,120
We profile dot in.

47
00:03:52,500 --> 00:04:03,120
VB 01. v profile dot in MK 01.0. n r MQ 01. v profile dot points to write IP addresses validated once

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:03,660
again.

49
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:10,760
If we are good with these entries, we can build our source code to an artifact.

50
00:04:11,390 --> 00:04:19,010
So let's go to the top level directory in a repository where we have bombed out XML file and here we'll

51
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,230
issue the command mv and install.

52
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:25,850
Which will generate our artifact in some time.

53
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,650
Now, again, this process is also going to take some time.

54
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,970
And I have fast forwarded the video and here we are.

55
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,150
Let's clear the screen.

56
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,640
The build was a success.

57
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:43,470
We have a target directory and we have our artifact v profile.

58
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,210
Hyphen v two dot var.

59
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:53,110
We'll store this artefact in an S3 bucket and on Tomcat server will download this artifact from the

60
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:54,220
same S3 bucket.

61
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,780
And we'll upload our artifact to S3 bucket from a command line.

62
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,030
So we need to install a CLI.

63
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:07,690
And again, you can open your PowerShell if you're in Windows.

64
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:17,270
If you're using MacBook Mac, PC Mac OS, then you can use your blue cast and install a clean.

65
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:25,490
Choko install a silly.

66
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,050
So by the time this is happening, we'll create an IM user.

67
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,920
Which will use for the authentication for CLA.

68
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,500
Let's go to Imam.

69
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:13,630
Users add user and let's give a user name and see if we profile one SW three hyphen admin.

70
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,330
Programmatic access.

71
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:26,640
Attach existing policy and we will give as three full access.

72
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,650
Be careful with this policy.

73
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,470
This is going to give you access to all the S3 bucket.

74
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:33,740
So do not lose access.

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,360
Key and secret key of this user.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,250
Do not expose it anywhere.

77
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:47,110
Let's download the credentials file.

78
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,040
After this setup is done.

79
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:56,930
Anyways, I'm going to delete this access key and secret key so I don't mind showing it to you.

80
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,230
But you don't do not expose it to anybody else.

81
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,940
I'm talking about your own access key.

82
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,350
As I told you, I'm going to delete this user and this access key.

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,650
Secret key, of course.

84
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,600
So I don't mind showing it to you.

85
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,670
But you be careful with your own keys.

86
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,500
Let's check A.W. Seelye.

87
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,180
It's installed.

88
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:27,210
Let's configure it publicly.

89
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:37,560
So I already have some access key and secret key saved.

90
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,060
I'm going to overwrite them.

91
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,840
We are using region US East one.

92
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,670
Format, Jason.

93
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,090
And is configured.

94
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,790
I will put in a three bucket now a, ss3 and B, keep the name s v profile hyphen.

95
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,610
Artifact hyphen storage.

96
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,690
A bucket is created.

97
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:32,380
Let me go to my source code repository.

98
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,480
Target directory there.

99
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:48,710
And I will copy my artifact S3 copy, which is v profile hyphen v two dot var in the strip bucket that

100
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,610
I created.

101
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:54,500
With that same name.

102
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,600
And this is done.

103
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,390
A w.

104
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,910
S three ls.

105
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,660
And the artifact is copied to S3 bucket.

106
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:25,830
In order to download this artifact in our Tomcat.

107
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,000
Easy, for instance.

108
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,530
We will create a role.

109
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,880
So let's go to Imam.

110
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:39,480
Let's go to roles.

111
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:42,320
Let's create a role.

112
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
Should be used by easy to.

113
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,010
Bombshell three for Lexis.

114
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,120
Next.

115
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:56,810
Skid Row.

116
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,190
Name of profile.

117
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,690
Hyphen Artifact.

118
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,020
Hyphen Storage.

119
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,460
Hyphen roll.

120
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:07,020
Create role.

121
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:15,920
Let's go to Easy, for instance, AB zero one action.

122
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,770
Settings modify.

123
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:23,370
I am role and let's select our role.

124
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,160
V Profile Artifact Storage role.

125
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,470
Oh, there's a typo.

126
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,170
Anyways, it will work.

127
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,540
Let's see if this.

128
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:44,310
Now our application server app zero one has authentication to access S3 bucket by using that role.

129
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,430
And it's time to log into App zero one.

130
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:04,540
Username Ubuntu and the IP address.

131
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,600
Oh, of course.

132
00:11:13,250 --> 00:11:16,730
We need to allow Port 22 in the security group.

133
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:26,380
22 from my IP so I can do such.

134
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,560
Okay, let's do it once again.

135
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:42,000
And we are in that's logging as the route user.

136
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:44,580
Let's check Tomcat service.

137
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,790
Tomcat eight.

138
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,800
It's running.

139
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,160
Let's go to var lib.

140
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,290
Tomcat eight.

141
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:57,330
Here we'll see.

142
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:58,650
Web apps directory.

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:08,550
We will delete this root directory, but before that we'll stop Tomcat eight service.

144
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:16,120
And we remove root directory which will have the default application.

145
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:21,630
And we will download our artifact from S3 bucket now.

146
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,580
For that we will need a c ly to be installed here as well.

147
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,290
So we are going to run apt install a w.

148
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,620
S cli.

149
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:43,730
Okay, UCLA is installed and I don't need to do a configure.

150
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:47,210
I'm going to just use the attached role.

151
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:50,570
So let's list our S3 bucket.

152
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,940
It's name V profile hyphen Artifact hyphen storage.

153
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,020
And it's the artifact.

154
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,480
Let's download it.

155
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,530
S3 copy.

156
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,070
Slash v profile v to dot var and we will download it in the temp directory for now.

157
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,240
And that was so quick.

158
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:27,490
Let's go to the team directory.

159
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,240
And we see our artifact here.

160
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:37,100
Let's copy our artifact to user lib.

161
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:37,840
Sorry.

162
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:46,510
It's var lib tomcat eight web apps with the name root dot var.

163
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:50,160
So that becomes then our default application.

164
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,420
Let's copy that.

165
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:57,400
And let's now start Tomcat eight service.

166
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,510
Okay, let's check.

167
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:12,010
Var lib tomcat eight web apps directory and it has extracted.

168
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,640
The rule directory.

169
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,300
Let's get into that.

170
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:28,580
And you'll have enough in D.C., have classes.

171
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:32,270
And there you have application properties file.

172
00:14:33,670 --> 00:14:35,200
With the right changes.

173
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:46,180
If you would like to validate a network connectivity, you can install Telnet.

174
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:52,980
Then it is already installed.

175
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:57,850
And you can just do telnet.

176
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:58,660
Let's do it.

177
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:06,080
Four db 01. v profile dot in port 3306.

178
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:10,720
If you are able to connect, the network is validated.

179
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:11,900
Yeah.

180
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,500
So that's making a connection you see there connected.

181
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,980
So it's resolving into right IP address.

182
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:20,620
Like that.

183
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:26,650
You can test MSC zero one on Port 11211 Rabbit Q and Port 5672.

184
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:32,740
Use this while you're doing troubleshooting when your application is not able to connect to backend

185
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,520
services.

186
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:40,150
Check the host the IP support numbers that it is using to connect to back end service telnet.

187
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:44,170
To that validate whether we are able to connect back in services or not.
