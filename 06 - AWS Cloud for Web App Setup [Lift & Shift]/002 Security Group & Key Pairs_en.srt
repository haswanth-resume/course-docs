1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,859
Let's dig in.

2
00:00:02,550 --> 00:00:04,830
I am logged into my account.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,200
I'm in North Virginia region.

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:14,110
And I also have a certificate which I'll be using.

5
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,160
For deep connection on load balancer.

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:25,300
I have mentioned the previous site video how to create this certificate and do its validation from your

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:26,560
domain provider.

8
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:28,830
I have a good idea.

9
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:34,680
Domain graphy dot n and I have seen some validation.

10
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,880
In this dense zones.

11
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:41,660
Okay, let's go back to loss console.

12
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,560
I'll go to easy to service.

13
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:49,400
First thing that we'll do is we'll create a security groups.

14
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,090
First, we'll create security group for our load balancer.

15
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,800
So let's go to security groups.

16
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,940
See create security group.

17
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:01,110
Let's give a name.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,070
Let's give some description.

19
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:19,010
And let's add the rules.

20
00:01:20,290 --> 00:01:22,540
And let's add inbound rules.

21
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,510
Inbound rules, not outbound rules.

22
00:01:26,510 --> 00:01:28,720
You are not going to touch outbound rules.

23
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,130
It should be always like this.

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,210
All traffic should go anywhere.

25
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,320
This will be for all the security groups that we will be creating.

26
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:39,390
Outbound rules should be like this.

27
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,880
We will be editing always inbound rules.

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,180
So first rule we will add is.

29
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:50,950
HDP bought 80 allowed from any IPV four.

30
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,240
And then again, you can just go here for 80.

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,640
Any IPV six.

32
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:02,090
Now some Internet service providers are giving IPV six.

33
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:09,169
So you should also use this rule to allow anywhere from IPV six for it is for initial purpose.

34
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,530
But our main goal is to use HTTPS 443 port.

35
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:19,130
So we will be accessing our website securely.

36
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,740
HTTPS connection on Port 443.

37
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,190
Let's see any IPV four again.

38
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:31,590
Any IPV six.

39
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,940
Later, once we set up the secure connection, we can remove this port at both the rules.

40
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:40,020
But for now we'll just create it.

41
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,750
C Create a security group.

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,340
Next, we'll create security group for our Tomcat instance.

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:54,850
We profile hyphen app hyphen SG.

44
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,840
Let's add a rule.

45
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:09,320
So our Tomcat service will be running on Port 88.

46
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:10,730
So let's go to that port.

47
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,280
And we'll allow traffic only from our load balancer.

48
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,870
So here we'll select the security group of the load balancer.

49
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:24,200
We'll give some description about traffic from LP.

50
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:30,610
And let's see if this.

51
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,460
One more security group.

52
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,250
This security group will be for our backend services.

53
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,640
Robert McHugh, Mom Cash and my SQL.

54
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:48,890
So we limit we profile hyphen backend.

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,150
She.

56
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,160
And let's add rule.

57
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:10,420
So we'll be running a MySQL service over here.

58
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,530
So let's select.

59
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,140
My SQL 3306 port allowed only from our application Security group.

60
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:24,120
Let's give a description.

61
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:37,740
We have two other sources that will be running in the security group.

62
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,480
Mom, cash and rabbit MQ.

63
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,310
Metcash will be running on port one one, two, one, one, and grab it.

64
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,870
McHugh will be running on board five, six, seven two.

65
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:51,120
If you're not so sure about it.

66
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,520
Let's check the source code.

67
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:59,240
Our application properties or application configuration file will definitely have the port number of

68
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,560
our backend services.

69
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,930
Let's open our source code.

70
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,840
If you're going to use branch left in shift.

71
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:11,460
I saw.

72
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,090
See?

73
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,800
Mean.

74
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,070
Resources application dot properties file.

75
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,360
So my SQL on Port 3306.

76
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:28,140
Gash on port.

77
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,290
One one, 211 rabbit McCue on board.

78
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,610
Five, six, seven two.

79
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,610
So we'll add these two rules as well.

80
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:39,870
One.

81
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,040
One, two, one, one.

82
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:45,130
Allowed from our security group application Security group.

83
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:52,350
And put five, six, seven two again from application security group.

84
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,560
So Tomcat, which is an application security group, can connect.

85
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:58,510
To all banking services on these boats.

86
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,410
Let's also give some description.

87
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:24,960
And now let's see this.

88
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:28,880
Okay.

89
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:33,280
We need to make one more change in our security group, in our back end security group.

90
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,980
We have three services.

91
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,840
And these services will be also interacting with each other.

92
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,640
So we are going to give a rule over here all traffic.

93
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,960
From itself.

94
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,000
Its own security group ID.

95
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:02,940
That's the final rule.

96
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,040
Let's save it.

97
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:12,460
And in any case, if you make any mistake in adding the rule, we can come back and make the changes.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,330
Now we will create a log key pair.

99
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,250
Which will use to log into our C two instances.

100
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,380
So go to key peers.

101
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,030
Create keeper.

102
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,610
Let's give a name V profile prod.

103
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:34,140
Key.

104
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:39,650
I'm going to use git bash for login, so I will use PEM format.

105
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,710
If you're going to use putty then use PKI format.

106
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:49,850
If you want to import your own key, you can do that.

107
00:07:50,990 --> 00:07:55,700
But we'll see these kinds of security approach in other projects.
