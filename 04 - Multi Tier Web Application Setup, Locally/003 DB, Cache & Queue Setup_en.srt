1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,950
Okay, now you can open the setup document

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,982
and you can follow the setup document.

3
00:00:20,126 --> 00:00:22,610
So we have already done our prerequisites.

4
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,886
Our VM are already set up.

5
00:00:25,008 --> 00:00:26,498
We did vagrant up. All the VMs

6
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,560
are up and we validated everything.

7
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,762
Now it's time for provisioning all these services

8
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,886
we are going to provision, but we are

9
00:00:33,888 --> 00:00:35,818
going to provision it in this order.

10
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,386
First MySQL, then Memcache, then RabbitMQ,

11
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,698
then Tomcat, and then NGINX and

12
00:00:41,724 --> 00:00:43,860
then finally we'll deploy our application.

13
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:48,766
Okay, let's first set up a MySQL service

14
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,060
and there are many commands over here.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,942
So in this section we

16
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:55,390
practice executing all these commands.

17
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:58,106
We will be doing all the setup manually.

18
00:00:58,178 --> 00:01:00,598
In the next section we will see how we

19
00:01:00,624 --> 00:01:04,269
will automate this entire setup by using Bash scripts.

20
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,594
If you understand all the commands well and good.

21
00:01:07,752 --> 00:01:10,860
If you do not understand, do not stress too much.

22
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,860
You will slowly get hold of this.

23
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,178
We will be seeing this product setup on AWS, containers etc...,

24
00:01:19,214 --> 00:01:22,090
different places, so you will get practice of it.

25
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:25,190
Okay, so let me open my git bash

26
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:28,200
and I will log into db01.

27
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,766
Okay, I am in.

28
00:01:31,828 --> 00:01:35,030
I'm going to switch to root user sudo -i

29
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:40,734
So it's a newly provisioned operating system and whenever

30
00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:44,354
and wherever you install or set up a new

31
00:01:44,392 --> 00:01:47,862
operating system, you should update all its packages.

32
00:01:47,946 --> 00:01:49,010
We will be doing it with

33
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,022
yum update command, yum update -y.

34
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:54,306
This is the command in centos

35
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:57,266
or any rpm based operating system.

36
00:01:57,328 --> 00:01:59,538
It will read all the old Rpm

37
00:01:59,574 --> 00:02:01,910
packages and update to a newer version.

38
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:04,094
This is going to take some time.

39
00:02:04,132 --> 00:02:05,558
I'm going to pause my screen and

40
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:07,670
come back when it is completed.

41
00:02:08,288 --> 00:02:10,190
Okay, that completed.

42
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,678
Now I will be running yum install epel-release.

43
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:18,278
This will enable EPEL repositories so

44
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,382
I can install many more softwares.

45
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,566
And it's already installed.

46
00:02:22,758 --> 00:02:23,822
Okay, next we will be

47
00:02:23,836 --> 00:02:26,080
installing Git and MariaDB service.

48
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,634
Okay, that got installed.

49
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:37,006
Now one quick note over here, mariadb

50
00:02:37,078 --> 00:02:41,058
Server or MySQL Server, both are the

51
00:02:41,084 --> 00:02:43,930
same service with different package names.

52
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:47,314
When it comes to Rpm based i:e CentOS, Fedora,

53
00:02:47,362 --> 00:02:50,266
we will be using MariaDB Hyphen Server package

54
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:54,322
In Ubuntu we still have MySQL Server.

55
00:02:54,466 --> 00:02:56,218
So if I say MySQL Server

56
00:02:56,254 --> 00:02:58,580
or MariaDB Server, it's the same thing?

57
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:03,320
Okay, next we will enable and start MariaDB service

58
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:08,314
systemctl start MariaDB and you see the package

59
00:03:08,362 --> 00:03:10,700
name is different and service name is different.

60
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,398
Sometimes package name and service name

61
00:03:13,424 --> 00:03:15,126
are same, sometimes they are different.

62
00:03:15,188 --> 00:03:17,420
So just need to find that out.

63
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,970
Okay, started and enabled.

64
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:23,230
Next we will be running a command.

65
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,430
Actually it's a script MySQL

66
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,326
underscore secure underscore installation.

67
00:03:29,398 --> 00:03:31,580
This is going to ask you a series of questions

68
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:35,550
just to make sure your MySQL service is secure.

69
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,170
So first enter root password.

70
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:40,090
We do not have any root password.

71
00:03:40,210 --> 00:03:41,874
Now this is the root password for

72
00:03:41,912 --> 00:03:45,226
MySQL service, not for the Linux.

73
00:03:45,418 --> 00:03:47,602
This is not Linux root user.

74
00:03:47,686 --> 00:03:49,400
Just hit enter over here.

75
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,778
And now you need to set root password.

76
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:53,480
So I'm going to say why yes.

77
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,840
And I'm setting admin123

78
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:01,062
I also recommend you use the same one just for now.

79
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:02,000
Hit enter.

80
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:12,238
Remove anonymous user y disallow root log in remotely.

81
00:04:12,394 --> 00:04:16,398
So with this root, user of MySQL, do you

82
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:19,642
want to log in from a different computer remotely?

83
00:04:19,786 --> 00:04:20,886
If you want, say yes.

84
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:23,730
If no, say and I will be keeping it as

85
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:26,900
yes because we may need to do some testing later.

86
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:30,320
Remove test database. Yes.

87
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:32,734
Reload privilege.

88
00:04:32,842 --> 00:04:35,000
It's like refresh. Yes.

89
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:36,918
Great.

90
00:04:37,004 --> 00:04:39,440
MariaDB service is secure now.

91
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:43,530
Okay, now we will log into this MariaDB service or

92
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:48,966
MySQL service by using MySQL client MySQL the user name

93
00:04:49,028 --> 00:04:53,720
root p and you can specify password here itself.

94
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,310
That is the password that I set.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,710
And no space in between P and the password. No space.

96
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,030
Just hit enter.

97
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,658
You will log into my ADB service. This is the prompt.

98
00:05:06,694 --> 00:05:08,002
You see the prompt has changed.

99
00:05:08,026 --> 00:05:10,290
Now Linux command won't work here.

100
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,440
Only SQL command will work.

101
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,186
So this is one SQL command that you are running.

102
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,638
First one, create database accounts.

103
00:05:17,674 --> 00:05:21,630
Make sure every SQL command ends with a semicolon.

104
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:25,894
So database name account is created.

105
00:05:25,942 --> 00:05:28,602
This is specifically for our view profile project.

106
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,558
Our V profile project will be

107
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:33,270
storing information in this database.

108
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,310
OK, next command.

109
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,818
Grant all privileges on accounts

110
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:42,046
database to the user admin.

111
00:05:42,118 --> 00:05:44,074
So this will also create a user admin.

112
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:47,482
Like we have the root user to log into MySQL.

113
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,510
We are creating here.

114
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,502
Admin user percent means @'%'.

115
00:05:51,526 --> 00:05:54,246
Percent means you can log in from

116
00:05:54,308 --> 00:05:56,290
anywhere, from locally or from remotely.

117
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,130
Also identified by admin123

118
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,966
That is the password of admin user.

119
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:04,950
And we see we have the same password for the root user.

120
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,598
Okay, you copy paste this or

121
00:06:09,624 --> 00:06:12,142
make sure your syntax is proper.

122
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:14,326
No mistakes over here.

123
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,610
Hit Enter.

124
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:18,218
Okay, if you get this error,

125
00:06:18,314 --> 00:06:19,978
better check your syntax now.

126
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:21,190
Syntax is all correct.

127
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,662
This is all copy paste problem.

128
00:06:23,856 --> 00:06:26,402
I'm going to run the same command, but this time I'm

129
00:06:26,426 --> 00:06:30,300
going to remove this single quote and add it once again.

130
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,890
Yeah, that's right. Not doing anything.

131
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,582
I'm not making any change.

132
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,158
This is copy paste.

133
00:06:36,194 --> 00:06:38,762
Mistake special characters.

134
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,286
Not exactly mistake.

135
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:42,230
Just remove all the single quote,

136
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:44,542
add them again and hit enter.

137
00:06:44,676 --> 00:06:45,780
It should work.

138
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,422
I know, surprise, right?

139
00:06:47,496 --> 00:06:49,800
Both the commands are exactly the same.

140
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:51,120
Won't work.

141
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:53,002
The other did not.

142
00:06:53,076 --> 00:06:55,898
That is because while doing copy

143
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:58,560
paste, sometimes special character changes.

144
00:06:59,790 --> 00:07:02,954
That is all I'm going to give this command.

145
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,010
Flush privileges.

146
00:07:04,130 --> 00:07:05,062
Hit enter.

147
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:08,426
So it's like refresh and then I'm

148
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:09,574
going to exit out of it.

149
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,586
Exit semicolon and out.

150
00:07:12,708 --> 00:07:16,094
So we are out of SQL prompt.

151
00:07:16,142 --> 00:07:17,890
We are back on our shell.

152
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,658
Okay, next command.

153
00:07:19,694 --> 00:07:21,298
We have created the database, but we

154
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,820
need to feed that with some data.

155
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,126
So we are going to download or clone the source code.

156
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:31,414
Download data from this link, go into that

157
00:07:31,452 --> 00:07:34,738
directory run this command which will feed all

158
00:07:34,764 --> 00:07:40,438
the SQL query into Accounts database and then

159
00:07:40,464 --> 00:07:42,214
we will check whether it worked or not.

160
00:07:42,252 --> 00:07:43,570
So let's do it.

161
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,180
Let's clone the source code.

162
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,998
This git clone command is basically

163
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:51,142
going to download all this data.

164
00:07:51,216 --> 00:07:53,110
If you do LS, you should find

165
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,306
a directory here v profile project.

166
00:07:55,488 --> 00:07:56,890
Just do CD.

167
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:04,742
We have SRC directory in that we

168
00:08:04,756 --> 00:08:08,010
have main in this we have resources.

169
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:11,934
And here you should have this file dbackup SQL.

170
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:13,362
You can do a cat to this file.

171
00:08:13,386 --> 00:08:15,534
You can see there are many SQL queries.

172
00:08:15,582 --> 00:08:16,754
You don't need to look into that.

173
00:08:16,792 --> 00:08:19,574
For now, all you need to do is run

174
00:08:19,612 --> 00:08:22,790
all this SQL query on your Accounts database. How?

175
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:31,538
Like this MySQL u root p password admin123

176
00:08:31,564 --> 00:08:39,462
input redirection SRC mainresourcesdbackup SQL when you're

177
00:08:39,486 --> 00:08:41,730
running this command, make sure you're in V profile

178
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:45,230
project directory and you have the proper path.

179
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,650
Run this command.

180
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,154
Oops, my mistake.

181
00:08:50,202 --> 00:08:51,762
We have to select the database.

182
00:08:51,846 --> 00:08:53,990
Give the database named accounts.

183
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,034
Now let's log into the database.

184
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,142
We will just give this much directly.

185
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:03,710
Log into account database.

186
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:05,620
I am in.

187
00:09:05,950 --> 00:09:07,610
Or wait, let me exit.

188
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:11,150
Clear the screen once again.

189
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,422
Let me log in and I'm going to say

190
00:09:15,496 --> 00:09:21,482
show tables and you should see all this.

191
00:09:21,556 --> 00:09:24,520
If for some reason you are not seeing this, then

192
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:29,118
do the set up again and check your previous command.

193
00:09:29,154 --> 00:09:30,366
What you executed.

194
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:32,498
You can run the history command and you can

195
00:09:32,524 --> 00:09:34,686
see all the commands that you have executed.

196
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:36,950
Sometimes we make mistake and that is fine.

197
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,800
Just check fix it.

198
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:44,102
Okay, now this is really not necessary, but if

199
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:48,830
we run this command system CTL restart mario DB.

200
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:51,278
If we have some mistake, it

201
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:55,120
can point out if it restarts. Fine. We are good.

202
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,630
Okay, the SMARTB service is up and running.

203
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,740
We have created the database and we are good here.

204
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,020
Okay, next service is Memcache which is pretty simple.

205
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:12,014
Just install the packages, start the service and run

206
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:15,340
this command which will allow access on port.

207
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,460
So let's do it.

208
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:27,680
Okay, so let's log out from DB and log into MC one.

209
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,098
Switch to root user and first run

210
00:10:35,184 --> 00:10:38,460
yum update y to patch this.

211
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:42,240
Okay, all the patching is done.

212
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:44,182
Clear the screen.

213
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:53,738
Let's install eplase package and now we

214
00:10:53,764 --> 00:10:56,606
will install let me clear the screen

215
00:10:56,728 --> 00:11:02,440
first and let's install Memcache d.

216
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,580
That's the only package we need to install over here.

217
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:13,586
Okay, package is installed.

218
00:11:13,718 --> 00:11:25,180
Let's start the service and also enable the service.

219
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,090
Let's check its status.

220
00:11:33,510 --> 00:11:34,750
It's active.

221
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,290
We have to run one more command for Memcache so

222
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:46,000
it can listen on TCP port and UDP port this.

223
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,706
So anyways you're going to access it on TCP port

224
00:11:49,888 --> 00:11:54,460
on this command and we are good to go.

225
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:00,026
We can validate if it's running on the right

226
00:12:00,088 --> 00:12:09,502
port which is and we see memcache service.

227
00:12:09,576 --> 00:12:14,400
We can see the PID it's open on port.

228
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,814
Okay, Memcache is set up let's log out from

229
00:12:19,852 --> 00:12:23,726
here and let's go to the next service which

230
00:12:23,788 --> 00:12:28,540
is a RabbitMQ RMQ one log into it.

231
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,734
Okay, we are in.

232
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:34,634
Let's become the root user and let's run

233
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:42,046
YM update y all the package update completed.

234
00:12:42,118 --> 00:12:44,550
Now let's see the installation steps.

235
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:48,850
First we need to install some dependencies.

236
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:52,950
One of them is Aslan and SOCAT.

237
00:12:53,810 --> 00:12:55,662
Installing aslan won't be direct.

238
00:12:55,736 --> 00:12:59,626
We have to download this rpm with Wgatcommand.

239
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:01,294
Install this Rpm.

240
00:13:01,402 --> 00:13:04,746
This Rpm will set us aslang repositories so

241
00:13:04,808 --> 00:13:08,194
we can install airlines with yum install command.

242
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:11,622
Once we have erlang and SOCAT installed then we

243
00:13:11,636 --> 00:13:15,018
are going to download a shell script and at

244
00:13:15,044 --> 00:13:17,010
the same time we execute the script.

245
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:20,898
Once the script is executed, it will set

246
00:13:20,924 --> 00:13:24,510
us repository to install RabbitMQ server packages.

247
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:26,898
Then with yum install command we

248
00:13:26,924 --> 00:13:29,314
can install RabbitMQ server package.

249
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:32,240
Then we start and enable the RabbitMQ service

250
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,420
and some configurations to do after that.

251
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,180
So let's get started with this.

252
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:40,770
Let's install Wget.

253
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:50,710
Let's clear the screen and go to temp directory.

254
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:58,130
Download this Rpm.

255
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:02,360
Let's install it.

256
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:04,914
And now we should be able

257
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:23,222
to install erlang and that's completed.

258
00:14:23,366 --> 00:14:30,498
Let's now install RabbitMQ server now with this command

259
00:14:30,534 --> 00:14:33,350
we're going to download the script and pipe it

260
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,350
with bash so it will also execute the script.

261
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:48,320
Okay, so as this is the repository is set up.

262
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:51,150
Now let's install RabbitMQ server

263
00:14:57,990 --> 00:14:59,642
and finally it's installed.

264
00:14:59,726 --> 00:15:10,060
Let's start enable the service

265
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:14,090
and let's check its status.

266
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,078
RabbitMQ service is active.

267
00:15:19,114 --> 00:15:24,210
Now we have some configuration changes with RabbitMQ.

268
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,174
So this command is basically going to

269
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,930
echo this output into this file.

270
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,330
And we also have to create user in RabbitMQ.

271
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:49,422
So that's the command RabbitMQ CTL add user.

272
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:51,666
That's the username and that's the password

273
00:15:51,738 --> 00:15:53,414
you can change if you want.

274
00:15:53,572 --> 00:15:57,558
But then remember whatever username and password

275
00:15:57,594 --> 00:15:58,982
you use because same we are going

276
00:15:58,996 --> 00:16:00,950
to give in the configuration file.

277
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:03,794
Next we are going to give

278
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:08,070
this user administrator privilege in RabbitMQ.

279
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:12,674
We do it like this rabbitmqctl set user tag the

280
00:16:12,712 --> 00:16:15,820
username and the tag that you are setting up.

281
00:16:16,270 --> 00:16:18,762
Okay, after making this configuration change, it's

282
00:16:18,786 --> 00:16:21,580
time to bounce the RabbitMQ service.

283
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:29,694
So the system CTL restart RabbitMQ server if

284
00:16:29,732 --> 00:16:33,270
everything is good, if configuration changes are good,

285
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,970
our RabbitMQ service should be running or else

286
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,060
you can see some error down there.

287
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,362
Okay, still here.

288
00:16:40,436 --> 00:16:41,770
The back end is setup.
