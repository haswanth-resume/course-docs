1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:08,560
And let's log into web01, and this is where we are going to set up Nginx website.

2
00:00:08,630 --> 00:00:12,260
web01 is ubuntu machine, all the other VMS were CentOS

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,660
web01 is going to be ubuntu.

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:23,600
So as we run yum update, here, we are going to run apt update and upgrade both.

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:29,320
apt upgrade -y

6
00:00:31,130 --> 00:00:33,140
Which will update all the packages.

7
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:44,680
All right, so upgrade completed successfully, let's log in as the root user now and we will install

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:46,780
finally the Nginx service.

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,170
apt install nginx.

10
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,860
And we are going to create a configuration file.

11
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:06,130
Which will be used to redirect request from nginx to tomcat server on port 880, so the Nginx

12
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,140
will basically act like a load balancer.

13
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:11,200
So create the file at this location.

14
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
Let me show you once again.

15
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:22,190
That location with that name vproapp, sites-available, this is where we create the configuration

16
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:25,940
and we create the file with the name vproapp.

17
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:31,090
And we are going to put this configuration.

18
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,550
So frontent, it's going to listen on port 80, if you access nginx service on port 80, it's going to

19
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:42,000
route the request to the vproapp server.

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,450
app01 on port 8080

21
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:50,850
If you have multiple application server behind the scene.

22
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:58,790
Then you can just copy the settings multiple times and you can change the hostname app01, app02

23
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:06,470
, like that, but we just have one application server and we have given its name and the port number

24
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:09,110
Tomcat runs by default on port 8080

25
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,780
OK, let's save this file.

26
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:24,150
And we're going to remove a default application or default website of Nginx, the path is /etc/

27
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:27,840
nginx/sites-enabled/default

28
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,260
And now we have to create a link, ln -s

29
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:41,380
Link of our configuration file at this particular location, you can give it with the same name,

30
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,040
vproapp

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,180
So this is going to enable our site.

32
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,430
Once the configuration change is is done, restart nginx service.

33
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,310
And that was the final command.

34
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,990
of our stack setup.
