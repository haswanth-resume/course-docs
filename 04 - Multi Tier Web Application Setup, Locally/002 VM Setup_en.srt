1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,680
Open your browser and access our source code URL.

2
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:13,270
Switch to branch.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,520
Local setup.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,010
In this branch, you will have a directory.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:20,990
Vagrant.

6
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:23,500
We have a four folders here.

7
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:26,900
We are doing manual provisioning, so we'll be using manual provisioning.

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:35,120
But if you have a mac OS M1 one or M2, then go manual provisioning Mac OS M1 directory.

9
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:42,170
I have windows here, so I'm going to click here on manual provisioning and also for Mac OS with Intel

10
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:45,110
CHIP, use this manual provisioning directory.

11
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:48,990
We have a Vagrantfile and a PDF.

12
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:58,510
This document will show you how you can set up this entire project step by step.

13
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,960
You can use it as a reference.

14
00:01:05,379 --> 00:01:12,160
And also we have a vagrant file here, of course, which is going to launch all our virtual machines

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,360
automatically.

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,630
So we will clone this source code on our local machine and we'll get started.

17
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,690
So I'm going to copy the URL.

18
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,800
Open my gate bash.

19
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:30,540
I'm going to get into f drive.

20
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:36,330
You can select any place, any directory in your system, Get into that.

21
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:41,730
If you're using Mac OS for your MacBook, then you can open your terminal.

22
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:50,010
You should have git already installed and I'm going to run the command git clone and paste the URL.

23
00:01:53,910 --> 00:01:57,750
This is going to clone the entire source code in my local machine.

24
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:00,190
Now.

25
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,580
Now I should see the file project directory.

26
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,050
That's my repository.

27
00:02:06,110 --> 00:02:07,610
I cd into that.

28
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,900
Let's clear the screen.

29
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,640
I'm going to switch to branch.

30
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:17,270
Local hyphen setup.

31
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,700
And I see the vagrant directory there.

32
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:25,730
Let's get into that.

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:29,840
And you see here the four folders based on your operating system.

34
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,550
Get into the right folder.

35
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:36,920
I'm getting into manual provisioning if you have a mac OS MX one MB two.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:45,820
Then just see underscore and mako as and one getting to that for a Windows and macOS with Intel chip

37
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,220
get into the manual provisioning directory.

38
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:50,620
Let me expand it.

39
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,480
Clear the screen.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:55,670
And we have the vagrant file over here.

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Let's see this vagrant file from Sublime text editor.

42
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:10,420
Okay, open my sublime text editor and I'm going to open folder where I have cloned my source code.

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,450
So yes, it's in f drive.

44
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,190
That's the repository.

45
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,560
And we'll say select folder.

46
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,930
Let's expand this.

47
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:25,360
So we have vagrant directory manual provisioning and the vagrant file there.

48
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,330
Let's understand this vagrantfile first.

49
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:34,120
Well, we will use this file to launch five virtual machine.

50
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:40,480
One will be engine X, one Tomcat, one rabbit MQ.

51
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:46,670
One is memcache and the other one is the db machine.

52
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:49,870
We have few global settings here.

53
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,980
config Host Manager enabled.

54
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,450
True.

55
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,380
So if you install the plugin.

56
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,710
Then the setting will automatically update hostname in each and every virtual machines.

57
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:10,290
So in every virtual machine in its host file, the host and IP addresses will be mapped and Gen X virtual

58
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:16,649
machine will have given name web zero one and it is going to be based on one two operating system.

59
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,790
That's the host name Web zero one, and it has a private IP.

60
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,470
You can keep the same IP.

61
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:30,170
It does not conflict with your existing network or else you can change the IP.

62
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,210
Don't get virtual machine name is AB zero one and we are going to use CentOS seven operating system

63
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:37,750
here.

64
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,700
IP address in the same network.

65
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,920
And we're also going to give it an extra boost of RAM one GB of RAM.

66
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,030
Next is a rabbit mq ar mq zero one.

67
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:57,430
This will be also based on center, a seven operating system and an IP address.

68
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,590
Next name?

69
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:01,370
Cash.

70
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:08,780
Name M.C. zero one based on, again, Centre seven and an IP address.

71
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,630
My sequel.

72
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:18,690
Name is DB zero one Center seven Operating system and again, IP address.

73
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:24,980
If you see all these IP address are in a same network and then they would be able to communicate also

74
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,940
with each other.

75
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:32,720
If you want to make any changes like hostname or IP address in scheme and save this file, make the

76
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,820
changes and save the file.

77
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,490
Okay, now let's bring up the stack.

78
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,890
Let's open our get bash.

79
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,220
You should be in this directory where you have the background file.

80
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:46,990
You can check it once again.

81
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,430
Kurt Wagner and file.

82
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:58,990
Before you bring up the virtual machine, you have to install this plugin necessarily, otherwise you

83
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,170
will get a host manager Unknown configuration error.

84
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:09,880
What this settings will do is this will automatically add host entries, map it with their IP addresses

85
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:13,510
of all the VMs in every virtual machine.

86
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,510
The second plugin is optional.

87
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:22,160
If you are getting the box FS error, then only install the second plugin.

88
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,340
But first plugin we need to install.

89
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,840
So let's copy that and let's install this plugin.

90
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:37,110
The plugin is installed beginning to run the command Valorant app, which will bring up all this virtual

91
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:37,830
machine.

92
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:43,010
So we already have Oracle VM virtual Box installed.

93
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:50,860
There's no virtual machine over here now, but in some time you will see all the virtual machine up

94
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,700
over here.

95
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:59,090
This is going to take some time and I'm going to pause my video.

96
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,130
All right.

97
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:30,600
All the vrms are up.

98
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:32,190
First, we have web zero one.

99
00:07:32,190 --> 00:07:34,830
That is one GB of ram.

100
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,570
Then we have AB 011 GB of RAM again.

101
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:44,620
So total two GB now Rabbit MK 512 GB That's fine.

102
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:46,710
Ma'am.

103
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:50,830
Cash five and two and B, So now total three GBPS.

104
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:59,290
And then finally, DB zero one also five one, two and B, So you will need almost two and a half to

105
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:03,100
three GB of RAM to set up this stack.

106
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:06,400
Boogie stack is set up, The beams are set up.

107
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,470
Let's make a test.

108
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:12,880
Let's validate Vagrant Search Web zero one first.

109
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,570
Cave urine.

110
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:22,990
Let's check the Etsy host file so this gets automatically updated, as I told you.

111
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:28,120
And let's see if we are able to ping app zero one.

112
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,620
Yes.

113
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:31,650
Let's log out from here.

114
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:35,289
Let's log into app zero one.

115
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,360
Okay, let's check etsy host file in app zero one.

116
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,559
Now it's also updated.

117
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:51,300
Let's bring the back end services which this machine will try to connect and see zero one.

118
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:52,870
R.

119
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:53,080
M.

120
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,810
q01.

121
00:08:58,630 --> 00:09:02,260
And of course, the DB zero one.

122
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:14,270
Okay, this is important to validate because our engine X is going to connect to our application server

123
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,560
and application server.

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:20,810
Tomcat is going to connect to DB, MSI and Rabbit MQ.

125
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:23,870
So we need to make this test now.

126
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,310
Let's log out from here.
