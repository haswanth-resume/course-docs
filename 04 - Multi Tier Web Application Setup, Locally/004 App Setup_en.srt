1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:10,110
db, memcache and rabbitmq. Now we will log into our main hero App 01, where we're going to set up a tomcat

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,070
tomcat service.

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,350
So in app01, switch to root user, run yum update -Y.

4
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:31,080
Update completed now, let's set up a epel release repository.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:34,250
OK.

6
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,000
That is done.

7
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,860
Now, dependency for Tomcat, which is jdk version 1.8

8
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:47,760
That's the dependency for our vprofile application.

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,050
So you also have a higher version of JDK now, but we have to go with 1.8 for our project.

10
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:03,410
Jdk is installed, few more tools, git maven me and wget, let's install these

11
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:12,170
OK, these tools are also installed, now we will download Tomcat, so let's go to /tmp dir.

12
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,520
We will download this specific tarball of Tomcat.

13
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:25,420
OK, we should have the tar ball of Tomcat and let's extract it.

14
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,430
OK, let's clear the screen.

15
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,190
We should see the Tomcat dir.

16
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,720
OK, let's see the next step.

17
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:49,850
So we have to add a user and which will create the Tomcat home dir for us, Tomcat is the username

18
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,290
and this will be the home directory.

19
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:53,810
This is where will copy all the Tomcat binaries.

20
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:56,180
So that command

21
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:04,580
And now you should have a user called Tomcat and you should have this home directory, /usr/local/tomcat8

22
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,510
/usr/local/tomcat8

23
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,880
And this is where we'll copy all our data.

24
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,560
So cp -r

25
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,280
tomcat dir /*. So copy, everything from there to /usr/local/tomcat

26
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:26,130
Now, just check, once you should see all these files in /usr/local/tomcat directory.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,200
OK, next step is to give.

28
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,650
Permission ownership of Tomcat user tomcat Group to all the content in the directory, so let's do

29
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:42,900
ls -l and you will see these are all owned by root users, so let's change that ownership.

30
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:47,070
We will say chown tomcat.tomcat.

31
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:55,260
/usr/local/tomcat8, and will give the option -r.So recursively everything

32
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:02,160
will be owned by tomcat user and the group, so you should see tomcat user ownership and group ownership.

33
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:03,180
OK.

34
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:03,940
All right.

35
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,150
Next step is to create this file.

36
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,890
tomcat.service file

37
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,600
And we have this entry over there, with help of this, we can use systemctl command to start, stop,

38
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:17,590
tomcat service.

39
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:22,990
So let's open that up with vim.

40
00:03:22,990 --> 00:03:24,220
It's going to be a new file.

41
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,100
OK, I will be using just vi.

42
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,250
And copy all this content carefully.

43
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:43,980
And past it here being an insert mode, let's do some lines spacing.

44
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,170
OK, so when we say systemctl start tomcat, it is going to run this command.

45
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,470
When we say systemctl stop tomcat, it will run this command.

46
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,170
So we don't need to manually run this command and we can enable the service by using systemctl.

47
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,100
So it comes at the boot time, which is very essential.

48
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:06,180
Let's save and quit.

49
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:14,050
Once you make any change to tomcat.service file, you have to say systemctl 

50
00:04:16,649 --> 00:04:22,980
systemctl  daemon-reload, so any other kind of services files also you you have in this directory, it will reload all

51
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:30,680
the changes and now you should be able to do systemctl enable tomcat.

52
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,620
So the service name is same as the file name tomcat.

53
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,830
Oops, that's my mistake.

54
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,530
OK, and then you can say systemctl start tomcat.

55
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,730
And let's check its status now.

56
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:57,000
And you should see active running if you see some problems over here, like failed.

57
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,640
Make sure you check the content in /usr/local/tomcat8

58
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,210
/usr/local/tomcat8

59
00:05:04,050 --> 00:05:13,170
Check the ownership of this dir and also inside the content should have tomcat ownership and

60
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,150
also verify this systemctl file

61
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,240
If you have the right content or there are no syntax errors.

62
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,230
So check all this fix things do systemctl daemon reload and it should be working, so tomcat 

63
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,450
service is up and running.

64
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:36,540
Now we are going to build artifacts from our source code and deploy to tomcat servers.

65
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,210
So let me clear the screen.

66
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:42,120
OK.

67
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,780
Let's see, we set up, memcache, rabbitmq is done

68
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,940
tomcat set up is done.

69
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:56,030
And now code build and deploy, so we're going to clone the source code.

70
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:03,350
We're going to build the source code by MAVEN and then we're going to deploy our artifact to Tomcat

71
00:06:03,350 --> 00:06:04,550
Web Apps Directory.

72
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,030
So let's do this.

73
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,060
OK, I'm in the /tmp dir still

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,990
And I'm going to clone the source code over here, git clone.

75
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,240
OK, source code is cloned, let's get into the source code directory.

76
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,650
git status

77
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:31,400
So you should be in this branch, local set up branch.

78
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,650
Now, before we build our artifact, we're going to update the configuration file.

79
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,860
That will be that will be used by our application to connect backend services, the database, memcache

80
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,060
and rabbitmq service.

81
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,790
And that file location is.

82
00:06:48,980 --> 00:07:00,020
In the repository, src/main/resources/application. properties file, open this file.

83
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:11,130
And make the required changes for a database. memcache, rabbitmq, So let's make changes to my

84
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:11,650
mysql

85
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:16,430
So we have created our VM and we have the host named DB 01.

86
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:20,620
And that's the same entry in /etc/host file, so we don't need to change this.

87
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:26,890
We have created a user admin, so we'll keep the same user over here with password admin one two three.

88
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:33,700
If you created the admin user with a different password change those, backend service mc01

89
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:40,200
We have the memcache service with the same name and running on the same port.

90
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:46,830
We already validated that, rabbitmq rmq01, port 5672

91
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:53,410
It runs on that port by default, and we created a user in rabbitmq with test and a password

92
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,370
test

93
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:02,640
So we really don't need to make any change, but this is a very important file, understand this file

94
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:09,720
very well because in further, the other projects, we have to keep making changes to this files.

95
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,710
So if you're good with all the changes, save and quit this file.

96
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:23,440
And run the command mvn install from the repository, which is going to build our artifact.

97
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:26,440
OK.

98
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:30,190
After some time, command completed successfully.

99
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,270
And it says we have artifact at this location.

100
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:40,120
ls, ls, so we have a target dir.

101
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:42,230
Let me clear the screen.

102
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:50,630
Let's get into the target dir and in this dir, you have vprofile-v2.war

103
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:55,460
that is our artifact and this we're going to deploy in tomcat server

104
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:59,870
And we have build the artifact in the Tomcat server itself.

105
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:02,090
So it's just going to be a copy command.

106
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:10,290
But first, I'm going to remove the default application of Tomcat, and for that purpose, first I'm

107
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:12,120
going to shut down.

108
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:16,050
tomcat service, systemctl stop tomcat

109
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:16,860
tomcat

110
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,680
Let's check its status if it's down.

111
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:37,070
And now we will remove the default application, /usr/local/tomcat8, you have webapps dir in this

112
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:43,820
and in this, you should have a root .If you have root and root.war both,  you can just say

113
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,030
ROOT*, but they'll be just ROOT dir for now.

114
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,430
So just remove that dir.

115
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:50,660
That's the default application.

116
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,200
It's gone.

117
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:59,760
And will replace our artifact, sorry, our default application that we just deleted by our artifact,

118
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:08,430
so will copy our artifact, vprofile-v2.war to /usr/local/tomcat8/webapps

119
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,190
with the name ROOT.war, make sure while you're copying, you give that name.

120
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:16,810
Let's copy that.

121
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,320
Let's check that it's copied or not.

122
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:29,880
OK, now we'll start the Tomcat service, so systemctl start Tomcat.

123
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,430
Once you run this command, it should extract the ROOT.war into a ROOT directory.

124
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:42,980
And now that our application becomes the default application for Tomcat.

125
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:48,450
After that, wait for a few minutes, our application takes little time to come up.

126
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:55,790
Now, by the time our Tomcat application is coming up, we'll set up Nginx service, our final service

127
00:10:55,790 --> 00:10:57,110
So lets exit from here.
