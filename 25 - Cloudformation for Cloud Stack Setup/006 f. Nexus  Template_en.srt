1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,600
Let's create the next template now after this, you can create it in any order, I'll go for next.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:09,000
This next nexxus don't Yamal.

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,430
Parameters seem as what we are doing it in Jenkins' plus one extra parameter, so I just copy everything

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:17,970
from here.

5
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,600
Plus, one more parameter, which will be the jinking security group, OK, so Jenkins Astatke name,

6
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:32,810
that's the name I'm giving for the property type string defoliating.

7
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,400
This is the name of the template.

8
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,020
OK, that's why I was telling you, use similar name as I'm using.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,070
Or if you're using a different name for your template, then make sure you're giving right name.

10
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:44,520
Viniar.

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:49,760
Importing the values back then, other three same properties.

12
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,530
OK, next is mappings of EMI so that also we can copy from here again.

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:09,090
OK, next is resourced to launch, for instance, this will be similar to the JENKINS'.

14
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:20,860
Resources that are illogicality, sutta instance, instant's deep kini am I don't need this.

15
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,000
Some dags.

16
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:30,970
Security groups referring to a security group that is not yet created, but we are going to created

17
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,330
instant profile and import value.

18
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:45,590
So it can dash that role user data script that will be different, of course, but similar process you're

19
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:52,400
going to set up next to us through a script and then you're going to download the backup from a bucket

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,900
and then extracted.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,130
OK, so installing this is this will be for the center.

22
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,090
I have to actually remove this map and this is not going to be for.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,630
Want to do this, I have to do mapping the image of the Center seven instance, I can take that from

24
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:12,500
the repository.

25
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:14,210
Schirach.

26
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,110
Nexxus.

27
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:25,740
These are the areas of the Centerstone instance, it's easy for me to copy if you want your for you

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,860
also you can copy it from the repository, but if you want, you can find the right amedee for yourself

29
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,060
and change the values there.

30
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,530
OK, let's go through this.

31
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,510
So installing JDK, installing A.W. Seelie.

32
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,960
Creating, directing AppNexus, creating a temporary or directly nexus in temp.

33
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,620
Download Nexxus from this URL.

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:06,050
And get it to take your name and remove the Tarbell sync temporariness, it directly will be extracted

35
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:08,030
to slash Nexxus.

36
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:16,830
And the user nexxus give the permission to this directory, so seems to have what we did in the CD project.

37
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,950
OK, then set up a system defined so you can manage Nexus with systems.

38
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:23,670
You come on.

39
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:32,630
Make sure you make a configuration change so you can run Nexxus Services, Nexxus user and start and

40
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,970
enable Nexus service by here, you should have the Nexus service up and running.

41
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:40,910
Next step is to download our data from the S3 bucket.

42
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,770
It allows us to keep.

43
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,890
But downloader of director.

44
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,130
So Kudayev, when you die, when we profile, that's my bucket name.

45
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:02,200
Yeah, and the archaic name Nexxus Hyphen, Kudi hyphen, vibro hyphen ProductID Desert.

46
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:10,410
What your name, whatever name you have taken, you give the right name here now directly go to obdurately

47
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,060
stop Nixa service, extract the Nexus Bako.

48
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:22,350
Make sure you tune the permission and then you start there and enable the next service finally rebooted,

49
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:27,830
that should set up the next service with the data, OK?

50
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:30,490
Next is the Nexus security group that we are creating.

51
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:34,180
So I'm giving the logical Odey, which I have used already here.

52
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Their security group, NextG.

53
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:47,570
Yeah, these things should match otherwise this Cusato solitudes 22 from IP data from IP 088, one from

54
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,880
IP nine.

55
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,430
But one more thing, right?

56
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,580
The JENKINS' is going to upload the artifact to Nexus.

57
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:57,390
So Jenkins' also needs to connect to Nexxus on Port Aditi one.

58
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:03,170
So this will create the security group, but then we need to update it with one more rule.

59
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:11,010
So I'm going to give a new logical idea here and see a nexus.

60
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:19,200
She interests going to use a new resource over here.

61
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:28,960
That one security group in Greece, which will inject new rules to an existing security group, properties

62
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,650
group, so for which security groups are trying to do this, so the U2 security group ID.

63
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,030
So for the security group, the same security group that the security nexuses astrological.

64
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:42,970
Odey So I have it in the same.

65
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,300
Template.

66
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:46,690
So I can use git attribute function.

67
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:52,840
So I'm going to function, get attribute Nexxus as a group, so that one.

68
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,430
And when I say group three, I get the group idea or hear something, security group ingress rule for

69
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:00,450
this particular group.

70
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:01,670
Next, a security group.

71
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,650
What is the rule?

72
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:10,930
Rule is IP Protocol TCP from 81 to 80, 81 allowed from a security group, from jinking security group.

73
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,020
So I have to say here.

74
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:14,670
Source.

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:20,710
So security group and why is this endangered their.

76
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,230
OK, this is fine sauce security group.

77
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:31,240
And now to give the Jenkins security group I.D., but we're exporting that.

78
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,830
Right, and Jenkins, their export named Genk hyphenates Jodi.

79
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:46,080
OK, so that is the name of the template, OK, hyphen is that should give Yemeni security group that

80
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,710
variable and we are taking it, accepting it.

81
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,390
We're here.

82
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,060
The name injunct so I can really see.

83
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,460
After imported the value a function import value.

84
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:10,450
And then substitute with Dawla Jenkins TICC name, so the variable I'm using over here, this is going

85
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,730
to return the Jenkins stack name.

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,830
Which actually I am storing it over here in the properties, OK?

87
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:23,040
Jenkins Techmeme and its value will be Jinkx, which is the name of the template.

88
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:31,290
OK, so that is like Genk hyphen is Jidi, which is going to give me the security group that is getting

89
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,340
exploded over here.

90
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,870
So the biggest problem, really, in Néstor Stack is exporting and importing value, once you get hold

91
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:47,130
of this one, exporting, importing, then Mr. Stack is really amazing thing, OK?

92
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:51,850
The only trouble that we face is exporting and importing values.

93
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:53,920
So surpassing values between two downplayed.

94
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,880
Remember, three steps of this.

95
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,440
You export something.

96
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:04,860
Then you take as a parameter input for that and then you use them.

97
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:12,230
OK, so it's three steps, multiple functions are involved over here, import value, export, import,

98
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:12,860
sub.

99
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:20,800
But once you get hold of this one, then you will always do next attack because it's very good for reusability.

100
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,350
And I can use this template individually or I can use it with the stack, also with the Néstor stack.
