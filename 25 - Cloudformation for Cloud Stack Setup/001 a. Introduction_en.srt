1
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,290
Forming a eastlack with cloud formation, that's what we're going to do in this project.

2
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:17,880
Welcome.

3
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:23,520
In this project, we're going to set up a stack of some services by using cloud formation.

4
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:36,970
OK, in this project, we're going to set up a CCD stack or a restore or CCD Jack Honorables on Eatables

5
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:38,070
Easy to insurgences.

6
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:46,300
We're going to set up our Jenkins' Nexxus, Sonoko Windows Server application server and database server.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,120
And yes, you can use this project for yourself, actually.

8
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:56,490
This project is for you to help you do all your R&D pipeline.

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,040
But that does not mean there is no real world use case for this.

10
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:05,680
We do similar things in real time, maybe instead of Jenkins' next.

11
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,140
So we have a stack of some other services.

12
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:16,030
So you want to bring back your Stacho services to life from a backup that you have taken somewhere you

13
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:17,600
can use a similar approach.

14
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:20,470
Now let's understand why we are doing this project.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:32,470
OK, we know for you or in a project, if you have to continuously maintain servers, easy instances

16
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:35,710
or any server with storage, there is a cost to it.

17
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,670
If it's continuously running, there'll be long term charges.

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:48,040
So we might think of taking a backup through RMI, taken Amayo, for instance, and storage dump it.

19
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,710
But then there's storage costs.

20
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,160
One, two are fine, but if you are like 10, 15, then the storage cost is more OK.

21
00:01:55,630 --> 00:02:00,160
So then we can delete it and then we can manually setup everything again.

22
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,600
But that's time consuming.

23
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:07,810
Now imagine you have to set up the entire ACSU stack, Nexxus Jenkins on a cube again and again and

24
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:12,460
again, as you've been doing in the projects, which is fine for project using step by step.

25
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,450
You can do it right.

26
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:19,930
But new technologies are changing the new new plug ins in Jenkins, a new new ways of doing city pipeline.

27
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:21,920
And you need to do all those R&D.

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,770
So doing a set up every time, if you don't want to dig back up, it will be time consuming.

29
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,590
Plus, there is huge chances of making human error and it's also difficult to remember what we did in

30
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:37,870
this such in such situations we can use.

31
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,330
Cloud formation enables us to confirmation is in automation tool or an automation service provided by

32
00:02:49,330 --> 00:02:55,390
AWB, if you have gone through confirmation introductory videos, if you already know confirmation,

33
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,880
you know, once you have your templates ready, it will be so easy to launch your stack.

34
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:04,450
Plus, if it's automated, then there is no chance of making human errors.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,880
In cloud formation, we like template so we can maintain the state of the infrastructure and cloud formation

36
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:19,660
and you can compare your template with the existing state of your infrastructure and make the differential

37
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,100
changes just like terraform.

38
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:30,420
And if everything are in template, text file, you can do version control, you have infrastructure

39
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,580
as a code, then it's repeatable.

40
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:36,870
You can do it as many as time for different different environments, reuseable for different different

41
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:38,490
environments and different different scopes.

42
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:50,130
OK, so we are going to use cloud formation, as I already discussed, and automate our established

43
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,320
cloud services.

44
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,340
So confirmation acts like a configuration management tool for eatables account.

45
00:03:58,050 --> 00:04:00,780
Let's just reiterate once again, what are we going to do in this project?

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,180
We are going to set up a select stack for our profile project, will have Jenkins', will have a nexus,

47
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:15,630
will have a Sonoko observer, plus some other services like Tomcat, MySQL, Memcache Robotham in the

48
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,589
backend services.

49
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:23,430
And we're going to fetch our data from the S3 bucket to restore the data that we have taken back up

50
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:25,410
in continuous delivery and project.

51
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,870
I've made a video in every project.

52
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,490
You can check how to take backup of your KRYSTEXXA.

53
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,330
You already need that backup in the next three buckets stored.

54
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,600
We are going to use that backup to restore our industry stack.

55
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,510
All right, then, let's make it happen.

56
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,460
OK, let's understand the flow of execution.

57
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,460
I hope you have gone through the introductory videos of cloud formation or you already have some experience

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,380
with permission.

59
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,890
So we're going to check your data on the three bucket we have taken back up in CD project of Jenkins'

60
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:07,210
next to Sonakshi, taken the data back tarballs on a three bucket.

61
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,110
So we're going to check that.

62
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,670
We're going to go down the bucket.

63
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,910
Namenda files file names in that S3 bucket.

64
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:18,540
We're going to create one more extra bucket to upload our templates that we're going to write.

65
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:23,060
So we're just going to create in this step, we'll just create the bucket and we'll create a folder

66
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:28,790
named Stack Hyphen template inside that initially keep the same folder name.

67
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Then later, if you want, you can change.

68
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,390
Then you have to change the templates also.

69
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:38,260
We didn't know down the bucket in the folder names, so we are two things to note down now.

70
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,590
We have an extra bucket where we have the data backup, so we have to narrow down its name and file

71
00:05:43,590 --> 00:05:48,750
names and another history bucket where we are going to upload our templates, the cloud formation template.

72
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:52,020
So we are going to go down that bucket name and the folder name inside that.

73
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:58,720
OK, we already have data now we can get started, we can create a key keeper that will be used to log

74
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,760
into instances that will get launched.

75
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:09,290
We are going to write a root template named Create Dot Wireman, you can choose to write a different

76
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:09,860
name also.

77
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,890
So this will be exoskeleton.

78
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:15,920
What we are going to do, this will be the main template.

79
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:18,890
That is that that is going to call the child templates.

80
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,550
So the child templates going to then write the child templates for CCD three roll document, a template

81
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:34,100
that is going to create an S3 three role which will be attached to two instances.

82
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,260
Then we're going to write another child template, Jenkins Dot Wireman, which will set up jinking service

83
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:46,670
on Ecija instance, download backup from the S3 Buchard, and for that we need the extra role.

84
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,890
But in this place, which is going to write, we are not going to execute.

85
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:55,500
We can run a test though, where the idea is to run everything from the root template as nested stack.

86
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,940
We're going to do a nested stack.

87
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,010
Then you begin to write a Nexus Dot Yamal template and it's going to set up Nexus, download the up

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:12,440
and restore it sooner, setting up Sooner Cube server and then restoring from the backup Windows Test

89
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:12,840
Server.

90
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:15,600
This is just provision and execute some powerful command.

91
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:22,320
Application server, which is going to set up to get service and download it to configurations from

92
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,090
the S3 bucket.

93
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:28,330
Database server just providing the service with some initial data, that's all.

94
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,450
Once we have it, we're going to update all this child name on the part in the three bucket into the

95
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:43,650
root template, once all our templates are ready template and all the child templates then begin to

96
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,100
upload.

97
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,860
All our child emptied the bucket that he created.

98
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,150
In the folder stack hyphen template.

99
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,430
And if you don't hear the final step is to create the Néstor tag by using our template secret template

100
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:58,040
document.

101
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:01,180
All right, then, let's get started.
