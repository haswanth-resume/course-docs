1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,530
OK, next, I will talk about the Windows Server.

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:16,320
OK, when guest dark yammered.

3
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:25,070
And this is also as similar as the setup of Jenkins, Nexis and sonar, except this is Windows Server.

4
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,320
So, Amy, it's of course, what will be of the Windows Server accepting this parameter for the rule

5
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:40,160
name Jenkins template name Libicki, name an instance due to small and bigger incidents like Sonorant

6
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,020
Nexus mapping of Microsoft Windows Server.

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,460
OK, resource windows test, logical and easy to instant's again, instant type keaney imagery.

8
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:55,360
Remove that.

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,040
Tag security group, wind test, S.G., which will go down there.

10
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:12,800
It's just profile, again, importing the value of the role profile name, user base64, sub power shall

11
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:14,960
not shelter power shell.

12
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:21,430
So installing May one, the spelling mistake there.

13
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:25,110
Google Chrome get.

14
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:34,050
And creating a jenkins' directly.

15
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,210
So some powerful commands there.

16
00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:42,330
What's going on is just going to set chocolate and then we're going to use chocolate to install Judy.

17
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:47,150
Give me one Google Chrome and get the Windows Test Security Group.

18
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:54,950
So one rule three three eight nine and out from my IP, and then we're updating it, security group,

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,000
security group, Ingress Windows Distinguished Operating Group.

20
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:03,950
All protocol, Social Security group jinking.

21
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:07,320
So we're allowing all traffic from jinking security group.

22
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:14,950
Then again, I'm updating jinking security group here also like we did in sonar back the other way.

23
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:23,270
Right, this allows all traffic from Jenkins and this resource is going to update jinking security group

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:27,590
and allow all traffic from Windows Security Group.

25
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:33,690
Yet here again, you can use get tribute, right, because it's creating and getting written the same

26
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:36,190
template so I can see when Industries G.

27
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:44,630
If you start logical idea of the security group group, so get the security group idea of windows and

28
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,580
that will be upgraded in the security rules.
