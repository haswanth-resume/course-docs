1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:05,260
OK, so the other template should be just similar.

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,510
Next, we're going to set up, so let's see if this.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:14,520
Civil liberties sonar.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,030
Darte Yamal.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,420
OK, this is as similar as the Jenkintown played via accepting.

6
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:33,670
The rolling Jenkins stack name we have parameter for IP name that also is coming from the master route

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,570
template, instant type mapping and mapping.

8
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,120
Resources logical.

9
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,570
In that instance, we are launching an instance, Sudheer Properties.

10
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:55,310
His name, image I.D., some tag security groups honor S.G., which is mentioned down there instanced

11
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:59,990
profile, same import value roll template name, there's a variable.

12
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,450
So in its value will be this.

13
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:07,410
OK, and that is coming from our master template.

14
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,810
Now, sorry, from this generation.

15
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:18,250
Across the street, all this value will be assigned over here and that is passed down.

16
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:26,080
Warrior Rolton proclaims its value will be Cadastral Hyphen Vestris?

17
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,090
S profile name.

18
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,230
That one CD30 downplayed.

19
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,680
OK, same thing what we did in Nexxus and Jenkins, OK, user data.

20
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,390
OK, see the entire sonor set up as we did in Sikri Pipeline.

21
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:50,160
OK, till the engineers set up the differences, we copy the.

22
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,210
Backup is three bucket name.

23
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:01,460
Your archive name downloaded to opt, this is sooner back up.

24
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,450
Extracted.

25
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,840
Give the permission, then the PostgreSQL sonar cube is when you bring up it's going to create a lot

26
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,850
of schemas in the polls.

27
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:17,200
Gursky also taken its backup, also extracted to Vasilyev.

28
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:25,200
Downloaded to Ghaleb, extracted, changed the permission start PostgreSQL and starts Owner-Occupied

29
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:27,530
and rebooted Sonor Cube.

30
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:33,470
This is necessary, OK, there's some issue so just keep that reboot once everything is done.

31
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,740
It bounced the reboot the entire instant's and your data will be back up.

32
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:46,270
OK, so no security group 22 allowed from my iPad, allowed from IP.

33
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:53,590
And also, we are adding a rule to allow a different Jenkins.

34
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:59,230
Jenkins is going to upload the report to Sonakshi observers of U.S. security group in Greece.

35
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,610
Sooner's, Ezgi.

36
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:06,460
OK, not once on the Regi group idea offered.

37
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,830
Social Security group.

38
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,390
The Jenkins' security group like.

39
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:23,730
And so when he says IP protocol minus one, that means all the protocol, all the protocol.

40
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:31,860
So like all traffic allowed from Jenkins like that, OK, we are updating also Jenkins' security group.

41
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:32,320
Yes.

42
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,250
In Sonar Templated updating jenkins' security group, because this traffic is going to be both Sonor

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,750
and Jenkins' so soon.

44
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,270
That allows all traffic from jinking security groups.

45
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:49,600
S.V. We are saying security group Ingress Gruppo, the import value jinking security group.

46
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,060
OK, all traffic.

47
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:55,630
So Security Group will be soon our security group.

48
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,920
You can see this is just the opposite of what we are doing over here.

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,420
Here we are allowing all traffic from jinking security group to Sonor.

50
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:10,300
Here we are allowing all traffic from Social Security group to jenkins'.

51
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,490
OK, and this is of templated updating the Jenkins' security group here, and we can do that because

52
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,700
we are exporting the Jenkins' security group Idee.

53
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:27,510
We can import it, use it security group, use the resource and update the rules, it care.

54
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,620
So that is sooner, let's see it.

55
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:36,780
Check it.

56
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,670
Very far from it, Sonador, Yamal from the repository.

57
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,690
If everything is good.
