1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:02,600
OK, so let's create the next template.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:16,149
For Jenkins instance, I'll give first parameters, the parameters that are supplied to this template.

3
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:18,560
First parameter.

4
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:26,730
So give some name, description, type, string, default value so you can set C.A.T. estriol.

5
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:31,480
So this should be the name of the template that is sending the output.

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:35,030
OK, C.A.T., estradiol.

7
00:00:37,810 --> 00:00:42,700
So the value it exports can be the story into this parameter.

8
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,280
OK.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,080
Secret template.

10
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,700
OK, this, but this template is sending two parameters Kinnamon my IP, so we have to accept those

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:54,930
two parameters also.

12
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:00,530
My IP type string.

13
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,340
Same name has is given over here.

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,400
Kini, nyp kini.

15
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,310
Third parameter.

16
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:16,820
Incidence type type string default value due to micro.

17
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:20,660
If you wish, you can change it while you're launching the instance.

18
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,430
So four parameters, really.

19
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,900
One is coming from our output.

20
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:37,850
In case you roll the other two next to coming from your master template or template key name in my IP.

21
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:46,090
And this is just a parameter whose value you can change it while you're launching this attack based

22
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,710
on which region this is launch, we're going to launch an easy distance from this.

23
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,410
So we have to set the EMI values based on the region.

24
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,580
We're going to do mapping.

25
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,320
Mappings, some name, give your region name, EMI and the EMI ID.

26
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:12,750
So this is open to 18 Amedee, so check your region, find the amenities, they should be safe, but

27
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,220
if it changes or if you're not able if you're getting an error, not able to find this Amedee while

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,070
you're launching this attack, then find the Amedee from the region that you use and make these entries

29
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,590
over there.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:31,530
OK, so I may be launching it into this region just one or two or US one or U.S. West one.

31
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:36,360
So I've just given the list of the region that I generally use.

32
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,650
Make a list like that and find DMORT.

33
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,150
OK, now we'll give the resource to launch Odyssey instance, so resources.

34
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:52,920
Let's take it one level down.

35
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,130
And Amy, does Jenkins' in in Jenkins' instance.

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,710
OK, Colin.

37
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:10,870
Type.

38
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,650
Less colon, colon to.

39
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:26,080
Capital, the colon colon instance, and then properties.

40
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,170
Instance type, so revoted instance time, we're taking the parameter NEITZEL By default to two micro.

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:48,940
OK, next, probably the key name, again, referring to key name over here that comes from your master

42
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:49,420
template.

43
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:58,200
OK, so user input that will be sent to the stimulate child template and then it will be assigned all

44
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,250
here in this property.

45
00:04:00,170 --> 00:04:01,490
OK, next image.

46
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,970
OK, so finding a map and then let's give.

47
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,220
So finding my in my region map, that's name.

48
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,720
It was a region that we have the value of the region where we are launching it.

49
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:24,620
So if you're doing it on us E two, then we'll get this right, because we said in that region, Emek

50
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,280
is the key.

51
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:34,120
So it's going to find that EMI and then the value will be taken and will be assigned to imagery sometimes.

52
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,680
And value is going to be joining with Jenkins' in this particular region.

53
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:47,630
So that is going to give us the region naem security groups.

54
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:52,470
I have not yet created the security group resource, but will Laforet it will create a security group

55
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,260
resource with this logical Odey Casal.

56
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,370
We already have the name.

57
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,110
OK, I am instance.

58
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,590
Profile.

59
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:15,050
If this is the one that we have already exported from C.A.T. history role and we are going to you imported,

60
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,520
so I'm going to say function.

61
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:23,880
Import.

62
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:25,670
Value.

63
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,720
Colin.

64
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:37,060
And I'm going to use function sub, which is going to substitute now dubh sub.

65
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,860
Donna.

66
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,860
So there again, this is going to have the exported value.

67
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,520
And inside that, we have.

68
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,440
That very.

69
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:10,450
So that we have the idea of your instanced profile.

70
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,040
So.

71
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,080
Import valediction to import disvalue and store it into this.

72
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:20,730
So this instance profile can be attached to the U.S. Dunstan's.

73
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:27,530
Which will give a street full access so this instance can download data from the EU budget, which will

74
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,070
need now in the user data.

75
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:35,150
We're going to write the script and have the script to set up Jenkins' instance.

76
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:45,460
OK, so that is the user data function, base64, base64, Wal-Mart substitute is a script, so things

77
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:52,630
that we already did install JDK install me one good unzip, install A.W. Seelie and then.

78
00:06:54,200 --> 00:07:00,590
Steps to install Jenkins, wait for 10 seconds, stop Jenkins, now Jenkins is installed, going to

79
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,230
stop Jenkins, wait for 10 seconds and then I'm going to download.

80
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,670
Data from the S3 Buckett in Vasiliev.

81
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:16,120
OK, so you have to give the bucket name over here on which you have taken the backup.

82
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:21,790
OK, that bucket name.

83
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:28,260
And which are already given and the archive file.

84
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:35,030
Jenkins underscores 60 jobs, dialogue and.

85
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,940
OK, so it's going to copy that file from the EU budget and put it in Vasiliev directly, then we do

86
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,370
see to validate it, to then be extracted, we change the ownership of the directive jenkins' jenkins'

87
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,440
user and then reboot.

88
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:59,230
Not mandatory, but safe to do reboot, not really mandatory, but nevertheless I do it so, you know,

89
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,260
everything gets loaded perfectly fine.

90
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,200
OK, now it's time to clear the Jenkins' Security Group.

91
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:13,690
You have to make sure in this particular incident, yeah.

92
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,080
OK, I'll see Jenkins.

93
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,430
ASG.

94
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:24,410
I have not recruited the Jenkins security group, but the logical idea I will give, same as I have

95
00:08:24,410 --> 00:08:27,410
mentioned over here, Jenkins is chief.

96
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,520
So I don't have any issues.

97
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:37,730
Two simple rules.

98
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,640
For the security group.

99
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:52,640
In Greece, 22 allowed from maybe OK, now this might be your offering is coming over here, maybe then

100
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,240
it is.

101
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,030
Supplied from here.

102
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:04,200
From your master template, which is going to be coming as a user input or the default value will be

103
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:04,680
passed.

104
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,440
OK, then I'm just giving from anywhere you can again change it to.

105
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,450
Jeff Miyabe.

106
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,010
My IP.

107
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,250
OK, that should be fine.

108
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,510
OK, we're going to output some value for printing and we're going to output the value of the jinking

109
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,990
security group to next instances, the next other instances that we are going to create is going to

110
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,810
allow port all traffic from jinking security group.

111
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:46,560
So when this dinking security group gets created, it will have an idea that we have to export for the

112
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,830
next template, plus a few more values to print.

113
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:51,690
OK, output.

114
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,980
We're just printing things.

115
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,980
Maintenance, public IP address value.

116
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,620
Gedda attribute jenkins' instance dot, public IP.

117
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:05,700
So jenkins' instance, dot public IP is going to return the public IP.

118
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:13,930
To getting the attribute there is just footprinting, also the private IP, OK, instance ID.

119
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:17,920
This just just for fun, OK?

120
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:22,980
All these three things, if you don't want to print it, fine, because anyways, once we launch the

121
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:26,910
instances, we can get that eyepiece by going to issue two instances.

122
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,710
But this is important.

123
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,860
We want the jinking security group to be exported for the next templated, so give us some name jinking

124
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:42,830
security group, some description value will be function, get attribute jenkins' security group gruppioni.

125
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,190
The two values are part of this function jenkins' as they are.

126
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,000
And the group.

127
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:56,790
So it's going to down a group idea and this is then exported to with this name Jinkx hyphen Asgharzadeh,

128
00:10:57,450 --> 00:11:00,520
which then can be used in other templates that we are going to create.

129
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:04,680
Now, again, if you wish to refer for this template.

130
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,770
So go to the repository.

131
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,720
OK, you can read all the details from here.
