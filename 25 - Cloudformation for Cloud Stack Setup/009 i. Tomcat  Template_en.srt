1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:02,040
OK, let's see that.

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:05,480
OK, next hour, Tomcat application server.

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:13,720
So named this the zero one QE darte YAML.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:17,180
So, again, similar story.

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,960
Taking parameters.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,390
Ahmed mapping.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:25,260
Went to him, OK?

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:29,030
We want to embrace launching the instance.

9
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:38,300
With the right role, so for this Tomcat server that gets created, will also download data actually

10
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:41,030
to configuration file that you already have interestedly Buckett.

11
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,980
Contact Tzadik, Semillon Tomcat uses Dodig Semmel, if you followed through the backup video, then

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,520
you would have taken backup of these two files as well.

13
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:05,000
OK, so the user data to install JDK download timecards set up Tomcat Hartill here we are setting up

14
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,190
Tomcat and then it is to download the Tomcat user's XML file.

15
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,970
At this location, us, our local Tomcat at Constant Caduceus SML, so this file will be overwritten

16
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:20,470
with the file that we are deploying.

17
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:23,930
Also, context, Artec, Semmel.

18
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,280
We shall be or return at this location.

19
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:36,160
OK, change ownership, Tom, get down here to use our local downgraded.

20
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,060
Create a system, define.

21
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:48,440
Start any animal down, get service, so as seen provisioning of a Doncasters that we did in products.

22
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:58,400
OK, then, security group, that's the logical as G 22 allowed from my iPad, allowed from anywhere,

23
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:01,330
because we're going to run software testing exit from the Internet.

24
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,720
So I'm single out from anywhere.

25
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:05,870
OK, then upgrade the security group rule.

26
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:10,039
It put 88 allowed from Jenkins.

27
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:16,350
Jenkins is going to upload the artifact to Tomcat, so we're going to see AT&T allowed from the Jenkins

28
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,000
security group.

29
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:28,400
And then we're going to output value over here, application security globally, the Dompierre security

30
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:28,670
group.

31
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:34,430
Now, this will be used in that database template again, that we are going right next and the last

32
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:34,670
one.

33
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:43,940
So the proposed group, we're going to export it with this name, the Peru app 01 Culiacan is the template

34
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,220
name hyphenated.

35
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,570
OK, see this?
