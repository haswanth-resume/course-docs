1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,070
OK, this is it, I'm going to do one thing, I'm going to create a director here named this stack hyphen

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:14,040
template, which is similar to same folder name as we created in the three Buchard.

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:18,690
But it's not it does not have any impact here.

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,590
Just for the sake of understanding.

5
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm just going to move all child and plate.

6
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:32,890
To stand there actually make you can't move this or move.

7
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,870
OK, let's try one by one.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,590
No.

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,690
It's not walking from here.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,240
I just do it from the show.

11
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,550
I'm going to move all of them to Stack downplayed.

12
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:57,240
And then I'm going to bring back the CIA CD.

13
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,080
Template here.

14
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:10,600
And just for understanding, it's not going to make any change.

15
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:11,240
In fact.

16
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:16,850
OK, we have one last thing to do in the templates.

17
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,450
So in a route template, we have to give all the child in place name.

18
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:36,130
So Azriel for Kulina templated CDs, three older women aren't seeing Sudie as three year old daughter

19
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,780
Hawaii.

20
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:45,960
OK, like that update, all the templates with the right, you all begin to upload it to the S3 bucket

21
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:47,390
if you have not yet done it.

22
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,530
But let's give the name first and then we'll upload.

23
00:01:50,830 --> 00:02:00,100
OK, we understood why I'm to be cured or why Animal Sonador, why animal next to I email I'm the one

24
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,320
kuai I am a Jenkins doctor, I am a three year old daughter.

25
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:11,050
I am an updated update your IP as well, whatever your current diabetes.

26
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,390
So you don't need to try it again.

27
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,400
And you as you can override that later.

28
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,070
OK, now time to upload our child template to a three bucket.

29
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:29,850
OK, so go to the bucket that you created for your template, get into the directly stack hyphen template.

30
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,720
Kaseem name.

31
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,130
Stack hyphen template.

32
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,420
OK, so it should be same named as in the all upload.

33
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:49,570
Our final OK, go to your territory where you have the template stack template, copy all of them.

34
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:52,200
And they applaud.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,660
Session has expired, Gary Log-in.

36
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,130
And upload.

37
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
OK, all of them are uploaded.

38
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:19,270
OK, so compared again, your bucket name slash template, so the stack template directly anda template

39
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,670
name with the URL if there is any mistake corrected.

40
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:27,850
OK, market names, the directly slash the template name seemed completely.

41
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,830
As you applauded in the bucket, once you're confirmed, everything is good.

42
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,060
Then let's go to the cloud formation service.

43
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,310
OK, and will create Jack.

44
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,630
Upload template.

45
00:03:54,370 --> 00:04:00,370
OK, so your route template, OK, Scotty template, not Winemiller template, which is in turn is going

46
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:06,340
to call all your child templates, all your nested stack template, which are already uploaded in the

47
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:07,030
bucket.

48
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,890
OK, so this template is going to call.

49
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,420
All these templates, which is already mentioned in the template template, you can check in the designer

50
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:17,380
who were in designer.

51
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,630
And see if there is any syntax error, anything you can fix that get, you see the lines that actually

52
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,650
depends on.

53
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,770
I validate.

54
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:34,140
See if there is any syntax that a template is valid, but it's going to only validate the root template.

55
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:39,220
Create Stack.

56
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's go next.

57
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:52,190
You can to name just the profile hyphen S.I Sude hyphen STAC.

58
00:04:53,440 --> 00:05:01,470
OK, parameters, you already created a key restack you and select that, change your IP if it's different,

59
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,190
that is the value coming from the template.

60
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:06,150
I'm good with that.

61
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:06,970
Let's go next.

62
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,150
And next.

63
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,390
OK, when you're creating a nested stack, you will get this, I acknowledge that Eatables confirmation

64
00:05:16,390 --> 00:05:21,880
might create a resource because recruiting I'm a resource and this option you will get might require

65
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,450
the following capability, capability to expand.

66
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,490
Just put a checkmark there and to create stack.

67
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:35,340
This is going to take some time, so I'm going to pause my skin and come back when this is completed.
