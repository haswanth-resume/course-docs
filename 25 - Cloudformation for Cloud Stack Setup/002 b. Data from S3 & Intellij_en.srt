1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,680
Any time in the project, if you wish to see the resources that we're using, you can use it as confirmation

2
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:09,560
documentation.

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,220
That's one thing.

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:17,770
And also all the templates that you're going to write in this project are already available in our repository.

5
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:24,640
So either you can clone it in your local machine if you don't have already clone or you can just check

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,390
it from the browser.

7
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:28,210
Also, cloud formation is the branch in the repository.

8
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,630
Kudi project.

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:34,410
So that's our main route to complete.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,160
So all the code of the root template.

11
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:42,600
And also our child emplace.

12
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:52,320
For example, let's take example of C.A.T. history rule so you can see already the template is available

13
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,830
over here.

14
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,120
This is for your reference.

15
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,300
We're going to do all this step by step.

16
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:01,110
We're going to create each and every file, link all of them together through route template.

17
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,760
And then we're going to create the stack.

18
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:11,810
OK, as already discussed, you should have already a backup on your S3 bucket of our S.A.T. data.

19
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:20,260
OK, so I have a bucket named CD Hyphen, detA, Hyphen V profile, and in this bucket I have Jenkins'

20
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:27,070
backup Nexxus Backup, PostgreSQL Sooner Cube and Tomcat user SML.

21
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:30,760
Also context are similar to configuration file and for archives.

22
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:38,590
I'm going to keep this tab open because I will need the bucket name and I will also need this file name

23
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:40,460
that I'm going to put in my templates.

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,060
OK, I'm going to create one more bucket.

25
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:46,510
I will leave it as a profile hyphen.

26
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:47,800
S.I Sudi.

27
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,780
IFN templates.

28
00:01:54,910 --> 00:02:01,240
I'm creating in the same region, Ohio region, willing to store our child templates into this bucket

29
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:03,010
or create this bucket.

30
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:13,980
Gave me that bucket and we have to create a folder with a specific name, stack hyphen template.

31
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:21,730
If you wish to create it with a different name, no down its name, so we're going to update this in

32
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,710
our automation template.

33
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:39,370
This is it, I'm going to upload my child template and address three Buchard that I have my back up

34
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,780
stored.

35
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,830
If you don't have this backup backup still don't worry, you can still follow along in the project.

36
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:50,620
Only thing is that you won't be able to restore the data, that's all.

37
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,490
But the project execution will go on fine anyways.

38
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:56,440
OK, now we're going to create a keeper.

39
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,570
Let me go to the Secret to Service.

40
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,330
Let's create a keeper.

41
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,200
We have to remember its name or any of us will get a job.

42
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:11,170
We can select the keeper and give them a CIA CD hyphen, STAC hyphen key.

43
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,220
Create Kiefer.

44
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,430
OK, now let's start writing our templates, so let me open in.

45
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:26,930
There is a cloud formation plugin in intelligence.

46
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,360
I already have it installed, if you want, you can install that.

47
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,320
Logging section, check for eatables cloud formation template and have it installed.

48
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,590
Out, you can just Google it, obvious cloud formation plugin.

49
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,230
Intelligence, you can install it like that.

50
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:50,640
Also.

51
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:55,720
Once you have it installed, restart your ID.
