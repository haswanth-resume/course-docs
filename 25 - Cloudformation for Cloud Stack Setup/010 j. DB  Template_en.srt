1
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:02,870
OK, final template.

2
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:07,300
Is B zero one.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:11,690
QE darte Yamal.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:19,050
You're going to need to write it again, just copied from the repository.

5
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,430
Same thing launching any instance damaged provisioning the instance with the user data.

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:26,590
This is sent seven.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,080
OK, so install database and we are not downloading anything from the EU budget.

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:33,760
Over here is normal.

9
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,630
Mystikal, Memcache and Rabu provisioning for We Profile Project.

10
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,670
OK, so three sources will be running over here and it's running on two to Micronesians and that is

11
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,070
fine as long as it does not crack.

12
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,140
OK, but if it cracks, then, you know, try changing the instant time that we should be better.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:01:01,260
OK, security group Rule 22 allowed from my IP and changing, updating the security group rule.

14
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,960
Saying all protocol of the Rudbeck, the security group for databased.

15
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,650
All protocol allowed from application security guru.

16
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:22,730
So here parameters, we are taking abstract name value zero hyphen Kuai.

17
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,080
Wheat exporting it here.

18
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:33,420
And then we're accepting our here in this parameter and then the way we're using it over here.

19
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:40,780
Again, I tell you, it's going to be three levels, right, export except as a parameter and then import

20
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,350
the value.

21
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,560
So this hyphen is is going to return the acidy from here.

22
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,590
And that should create your database instance.
