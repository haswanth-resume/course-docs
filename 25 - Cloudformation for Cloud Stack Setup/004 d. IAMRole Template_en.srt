1
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:03,030
OK, next template is our.

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:10,200
First template in our CDs is Astraea rule for Cecilio giving the right template for this.

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,940
And it was confirmation Yamal downplayed.

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,990
Amy, the CIA sued three rule dot, yeah.

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,960
And I don't need this if you have never created a resource stream and you never created a rule, I am

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,990
role, then you can check from the documentation how to create it for Mission User Guide.

7
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:47,020
Let's go to template reference resources and property.

8
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:55,810
I am also so let's find the IMS service, I am I there I am.

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,610
And I am role, let's click on that.

10
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,640
OK, let's make it smaller.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:05,080
We're going to use Jason.

12
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,340
Now, Jason, Yemen, so that these are the properties can directly go to the example and see how it

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:11,780
is done.

14
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,830
OK, so there are two things done when we create I am through cloud formation template, we have to

15
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:26,750
create the role and we have to create the profile instance profile.

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:31,760
When you do it through console, this gets you just create the role and we create the instant profile

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,080
you don't need to create separately.

18
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:42,870
So resources, the name, the logical odor, you can give it Iblis, I am rural properties, you have

19
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:51,240
assume rule policy document the vision statement effect, allow principle service that is going to use

20
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:51,800
this rule.

21
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,220
That's where our main attention is.

22
00:01:54,220 --> 00:02:01,080
So this role we're going to create is going to be for EU action estis assume roles that can assume that

23
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,350
role.

24
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:07,670
OK, Path is Route Policy's name of a policy.

25
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:15,010
Policy document, vision, no statement effect, allow action, what action you can define the actions,

26
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,410
read, write, list, all the other actions.

27
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,650
Resources for which resource?

28
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,870
This is for easy to solve is so easy to do so we can take action on which resource S3.

29
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:33,480
Dinamo would what are you are actually going to use Stryder, OK, so then instanced profile, including

30
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:39,260
instanced profiler's illogicality path route disinformation rules.

31
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:44,330
The role that you created up here would rule that illogicality.

32
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:52,110
OK, so this creates the instant profile also, if you want to know more about all these options, everything

33
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:57,570
is mentioned in the documentation, you can read about them a role in what you have to give police's

34
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,180
permission, boundaries you can set forth.

35
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,770
What are the path that we are setting.

36
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,550
OK, I'm going to take this example and I'm going to make changes toward.

37
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,200
Kopi.

38
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:23,620
OK, first, the logical idea will change as a VP, like we profile as three role, that should be fine.

39
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,640
I'm going to as I assign you don't do so.

40
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:27,340
This is fine.

41
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,510
There's no ruling given over here I'm going to give the ruling name.

42
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,630
That's the option name.

43
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:45,530
OK, so that's the only way I'm going to give OK, now to showing everything that you see, it's showing

44
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,720
the documentation also.

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:47,990
That's pretty nice.

46
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,800
OK, so you don't need to go to chlorpromazine.

47
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:56,900
Also, every time I saw the confirmation documentation, you don't need to go, OK, that is going to

48
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:58,010
create the policy.

49
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:00,410
I'm going to give policies and different name.

50
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,800
The profile is three full access.

51
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:16,490
Resource allocation, the resource which I'm going I'm going to give Iran a W.S. Colen history, so

52
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,390
you have to give it in air.

53
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,230
Informatica.

54
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,800
Star, that is important.

55
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,870
OK, for instance, profi, we can change this illogicality, we can change this name also OK, with

56
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:37,560
Phoebe instanced profile, Raffo refer to Zietz only showing that as red does not exist because that's

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,540
the name we have given to our.

58
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,340
Resource.

59
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,960
Yes, OK.

60
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:51,810
Also, you can give name your instant profile, instant profile name, that's the option.

61
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,680
And the name.

62
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,640
OK, see this?

63
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,390
And ladies, again, in our motion control, so you can any time go and check.

64
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:03,290
Combatted.

65
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:06,220
That's yeah, that's already open to.

66
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:14,770
So, you know, go to the cloud formation branch, check CCD, all dot Yamal, compare it with your

67
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:15,310
template.

68
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:22,700
OK, one more thing we have to do over here is we have to.

69
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:33,890
Export the information of this role so it can be imported in the next Templer, Jenkins is going to

70
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,110
assume this role and we to attach this role to the Jenkins' instance.

71
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:47,410
So we have to export the data from here so we can import, so not like we're exporting the detail about

72
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:52,720
this role so it can be imported in other template like Jenkins'.

73
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,090
For that, we use Output's.

74
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:02,350
Outputs.

75
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:08,730
And we can give some name, like I'm saying, BP free all details.

76
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:16,320
Description, if you want, why it's not highlighting syntax.

77
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,270
OK, value.

78
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,180
The capital there.

79
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:31,360
So we have to actually refer to the profile name, exclamation.

80
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:36,210
It just this.

81
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,250
OK, so this is the output, so this will print the output, but we want to export it.

82
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:47,900
So here to give an option export.

83
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:58,620
And you have to give me name, so I'm going to give the name of this template, see this as three.

84
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:06,400
Rule, which is important to give the rule in the name of the template, codicils the name, or either

85
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,560
you can use the variable dollar calibrates, you can establish track name, we can use that also.

86
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,130
And then hyphen some name.

87
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:21,540
So so this will be actually the name of the variable that we can import it later in the next template.

88
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:30,200
OK, so this template is ready, this should create an three roll, I'm sorry, and I am roll with S3

89
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,830
full access and should export the details of it.

90
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:35,720
So next it can imported.
