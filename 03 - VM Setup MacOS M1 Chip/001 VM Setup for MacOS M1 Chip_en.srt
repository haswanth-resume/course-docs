00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,730
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:06,689
In this lecture, we will see how to create virtual machines on a mac OS.

3
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,700
This is more specific to the M1 chip.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,309
The most popular Veeam creation tool is Oracle Veeam Virtual Box.

5
00:00:17,290 --> 00:00:21,160
But on mac OS M1 chip, it is not supported.

6
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:28,650
So we will be using VMware desktop to create virtual machines and to automatically create virtual machines.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:30,460
We will be using Vagrant.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:38,800
So we have to set up a vagrant plus a VMware desktop Fusion in this lecture also.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,790
Then we will see how to create a virtual machine by using Vagrant and VMware.

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:53,710
Together we will create a Ubuntu operating system, VM and another VM with Fedora, which is similar

11
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:56,080
to CentOS operating system.

12
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:04,290
Okay, so this is the ten step guide of how to set up a virtual machine on your Mac OS.

13
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,900
So download this document and from the resource section and go through it.

14
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,620
Most of them are commands that we will be running on the terminal.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:17,920
Also, you have to create an account on a VMware.

16
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:23,790
I've given the link over here, but most of the steps are going to be getting executed on the terminal.

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:27,840
So let's open the terminal.

18
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,900
And let's run the commands one by one.

19
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:36,530
Forced installing Rosetta.

20
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
So just copy paste the command.

21
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:43,890
Second installing vagrant with brew.

22
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,500
Okay, next.

23
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,400
Third, you need to create an account on a VMware website here.

24
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:59,620
So sign up, create an account, then login with that account and there is a link.

25
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,580
Click on that and download VMware Fusion and install it.

26
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,810
So after logged in, once you click on the link, you should come to this page.

27
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,820
Download VMware Fusion.

28
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,380
Open the software.

29
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:18,490
Click on that.

30
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:22,020
And it should start the installation.

31
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:31,050
OC open system preferences.

32
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,970
And provide accessibility to VMware Fusion.

33
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,070
Click on this lock.

34
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,610
Enter your password.

35
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:47,710
And put a checkmark on VMware Fusion there and that is installed and it has permission now.

36
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,360
Okay, Next.

37
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,970
Copy this command and create a link.

38
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,370
This link is created.

39
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:12,150
Now we will use this link and download VMware provider, so let's copy this link.

40
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:16,060
Okay.

41
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,730
So once this is downloaded, install it.

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,190
Double click on that icon and it should start the installation.

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,130
Enter your password.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,140
Next install this vagrant plugin.

45
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,570
Okay, so we are now done with the setup.

46
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:02,130
Now it's time to create a virtual machine by using Vagrant and VMware.

47
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:04,410
So let me clear the screen here.

48
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,860
And let me make this full screen terminal.

49
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:13,200
I guess we are going to create two virtual machine.

50
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,399
One is open to other, one is Fedora.

51
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:23,990
Fedora is similar to send to a seven or just send to us whenever I see centers for Windows user.

52
00:04:23,990 --> 00:04:30,680
You have to understand that I'm talking about Fedora for MacBook M1 and M2 chip.

53
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:33,020
I'll come to that point in a moment.

54
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,210
Let's go to the document first.

55
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,940
Okay, So the steps are we need to create this folder VMs open to inside that we need to place a file

56
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:49,600
called Vagrant file with V Capital, and the content of that file will be this.

57
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,580
Okay, so let's create the folders or directories.

58
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:02,670
So come back to the terminal, run p w d command, see where you are users.

59
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,870
Imran I'm in my home directory.

60
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,640
I do ls.

61
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:08,820
Look here.

62
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,390
I'm going to get into the desktop directory.

63
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,800
So CD desktop in that we are going to create a folder called us VMs.

64
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:28,050
We go into that VMs folder and inside that we're going to create a folder called as Ubuntu.

65
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:29,240
That's the first.

66
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:32,630
Let's, let's create one more folder.

67
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:35,170
Federal.

68
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:43,100
Okay, then let's get into the Ubuntu folder.

69
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,210
Run p w d command.

70
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,900
You should be in this place if you are ever lost.

71
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,120
Just type c d and hit enter.

72
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,110
You will come back to your home directory.

73
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,850
This is the symbol of the home directory, this tilde.

74
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,770
So I'm in my home directory.

75
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:04,450
I'm going to get into desktop VMs open to.

76
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:09,000
Let's clear the screen.

77
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:13,910
Once again, we're going to run the command volume.

78
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:18,720
This is a text editor and we give the file name, vagrant file.

79
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:25,870
Make sure the file name is exactly as it is V Capital, all the other small and there is no extension

80
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,860
at the end.

81
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,340
And hit enter.

82
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:34,920
When you do this, this is going to open up a file with the name of Vagrant file.

83
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:39,290
And you should see here new and the file name.

84
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:41,900
You need to get into insert mode.

85
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,780
Type I as in India.

86
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:48,360
And you will see you are in insert mode here.

87
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,970
Now you can type the content over here.

88
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
But not typing just anything.

89
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,650
We are going to copy this content.

90
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,620
Select this content Control authority command.

91
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:00,250
See?

92
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,120
Go back to the terminal Command V.

93
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,020
Paste it.

94
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,940
Now escape.

95
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:09,590
Make sure you hit escape.

96
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,350
The insert mode will be gone.

97
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,720
Now you have to hit.

98
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,810
Colon w q save and quit.

99
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,350
Or write and quit.

100
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:18,680
Hit.

101
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,220
Enter.

102
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,260
You do less and now you will see a vagrant file.

103
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:23,570
Here.

104
00:07:23,570 --> 00:07:27,200
You can run cat command to print the content of this file.

105
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:28,580
Cat Vagrant file.

106
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,370
Now let's understand a few lines of this code.

107
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,140
Later, we will dive deep into Valorant in the background section.

108
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,600
But for now, a few things you need to understand.

109
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,000
One is the box name here.

110
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,940
Config dot vm, dot box box.

111
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:47,030
You can also call them as images VM images.

112
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:50,780
These are readymade images available on Vagrant Cloud.

113
00:07:51,290 --> 00:07:58,220
So when we run the command vagrant up, it is going to first download this box and then create a VM

114
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,000
from that.

115
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,330
And the IPO of the film will be this.

116
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:06,050
And we are using VMware desktop to create VMs.

117
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,540
Okay, So let me take you to one green cloud.

118
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,320
Okay, so just search for Vagrant Cloud on Google.

119
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:19,120
And that's the first link.

120
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:24,810
So there are many boxes over here or images over here.

121
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,730
We need to find appropriate one.

122
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:35,010
So in the dropdown, click on VMware desktop because we are using VMware desktop and Mac OS, M one

123
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,490
and M two.

124
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:40,230
Chip has the erm architecture just type erm in the search.

125
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:47,220
And you will see all the ARM based boxes for VMware desktop.

126
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:53,250
Now, they're not many and many of them doesn't work properly with our setup.

127
00:08:53,520 --> 00:09:00,110
The box team that I have selected is the one that I tested it and many people have tested it.

128
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,350
It works very well.

129
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:04,630
And we will be using this box.

130
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,730
But if you want to find the boxes, a different box, I have shown you how you can do that.

131
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,500
You can just change it over here.

132
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,020
Now, this box I'm using this version, this is specific version that we want.

133
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,590
Now.

134
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:21,740
If you're using any other box, do not mention any version.

135
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,320
It will just download the latest version of the box.

136
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:28,100
This version again is only for this box.

137
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,500
And we are going to run a command of vagrant up.

138
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:34,950
Which will.

139
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:37,340
Download the box first.

140
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:42,830
Now I already have this box downloaded in the machine so it is not going to download once again for

141
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,610
you first time.

142
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,770
It is going to download and bring up a VM.

143
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,900
It is going to open up this UI which will show you the VM coming up.

144
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:52,430
You don't need to do anything over here.

145
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:53,930
Just minimize this.

146
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,090
Or maybe take a look and then minimize.

147
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,100
You need to be on the terminal only.

148
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,790
I see the VM is coming up.

149
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,820
You see, it took hardly a minute to bring up the VM.

150
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,450
First time.

151
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:07,800
It will take a little long.

152
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,440
Now the VM is up to log in.

153
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,130
Inside this VM, you need to run the command vagrant search.

154
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,140
Ragland said.

155
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:20,110
You need to make sure you are in that same folder.

156
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,830
So this will log in in the VM.

157
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:25,920
Now you see the prompt has changed.

158
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:29,290
Look at this prompt and look at the previous prompt.

159
00:10:29,310 --> 00:10:33,030
This was the MacBook Prompt and now we are in the VM.

160
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:34,410
This is the VM prompt.

161
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,190
You run the command.

162
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,950
Pseudo hyphen i.

163
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:46,570
And when the command ip id r show to see whether you got the IP address or not, that's the IP address

164
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:47,390
of your VM.

165
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,880
Yep, That's all here.

166
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,010
Just exit.

167
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,620
Once again type exit.

168
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:59,090
Till you come back to your prompt, you're logged out of the venue.

169
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,270
Exit the last time we are back.

170
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,070
Now, let me clear the screen.

171
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:12,260
You can run the command vagrant status to check the status or status of your VM, and it says it is

172
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:12,920
running.

173
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:15,020
We are going to power off.

174
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,470
Vagrant.

175
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,130
Halt!

176
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,840
Which is to power off or shut down.

177
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,790
That's off.

178
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,060
Let's check the status once again.

179
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:29,820
You can do the up arrow and go to the previous command.

180
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,530
Migrant status.

181
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:34,470
Okay.

182
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:36,640
You see, it is not running.

183
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:41,380
Now you can any time just run vagrant up as it sees and bring up the VM.

184
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,190
If you don't need it, you can also delete it.

185
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:45,990
Vagrant and destroy.

186
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,890
Yes.

187
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:51,280
Why?

188
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:51,970
For yes.

189
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,170
And it is going to delete.

190
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,850
Destroy means delete the VM.

191
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,320
The VM will be gone.

192
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,520
If you run Vagrant up, the VM will come back.

193
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,950
But it is going to be a new VM after that.

194
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,590
Now that's about open to.

195
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,430
Let's go to now fedora.

196
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,060
So again type CD and hit enter.

197
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,860
Clear the screen.

198
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,480
Let's go to desktop vms.

199
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,920
Fedora.

200
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,550
And let's do the same over here.

201
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:21,980
There's no file here now.

202
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,940
V, I am vagrant file.

203
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:24,510
Once again.

204
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,470
V Capital.

205
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:26,910
Hit enter.

206
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:29,070
Get into the insert mode.

207
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:30,540
I as in India.

208
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:31,920
Within insert mode.

209
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,360
Let's go to the document.

210
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:38,020
And this is the setting or configuration for Fedora.

211
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,430
Let's copy all this.

212
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,620
Command C.

213
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,370
Let's go back.

214
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:45,380
Come on.

215
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,500
V basted.

216
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:48,870
Okay.

217
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,390
Here, you see the box name?

218
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,970
It's different for open two.

219
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,490
We had an open two box for here for Federer.

220
00:12:55,490 --> 00:12:57,740
Obviously we have Federer 35 box.

221
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:06,290
And whenever I see center is seven or center is eight, anything sent to us in the lectures for Windows

222
00:13:06,290 --> 00:13:14,570
user, that means for MacBook, M1 and M1 chip, sorry, M1 and M2 chip, you need to go with this box.

223
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,740
Federer 35.

224
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:24,680
Exactly this box you can experiment with other box later, but for now, just keep that box escape colon.

225
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,900
W q say when could.

226
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:31,540
And we're going to say vagrant up.

227
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,180
Which will bring up a federal VMM for us.

228
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:37,390
Okay.

229
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,950
Again, it opens up this DUI.

230
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,040
It can minimize that.

231
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,330
We are not using that.

232
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,100
We'll be using terminal.

233
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,100
Okay, the VM is up.

234
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,470
Let's check migrant status.

235
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,740
Right.

236
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:53,550
It's running.

237
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,050
Let me clear the screen.

238
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:59,620
Let's do vagrant search to log in now.

239
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,710
I will be logging into the federal VM now.

240
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:02,220
Right.

241
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:04,860
And I need to be in that directory.

242
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:06,360
See the prompt?

243
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,180
I'm in the VM pseudo hyphen i.

244
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,090
IP ADR show.

245
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,630
Yeah.

246
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:18,960
Got vip v good exit.

247
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:21,210
And once again, exit.

248
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,700
And we are back to our MacBook.

249
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:26,630
Okay.

250
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,730
Now let's power off.

251
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:31,670
Or I can just delete it and destroy.

252
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,900
I can do that as well.

253
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:36,230
Hyphen, hyphen, hyphen, hyphen force.

254
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,970
Forcefully delete the VM.

255
00:14:37,970 --> 00:14:39,230
Don't ask me any question.

256
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,790
Just delete it like that.

257
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,920
And whenever you want to bring up the theme or any theme.

258
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,770
So I'm back to a normal terminal.

259
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,520
I'm in the home directory, I go to VMs.

260
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:56,580
Sorry, I go to desktop VMs.

261
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:58,450
I can type.

262
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:00,490
I go to one, two.

263
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:05,500
There's the vagrant file, and I can just do vagrant up.

264
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:07,300
Or you can check the status first.

265
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,440
Vagrant up.

266
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:14,350
And this will bring up the VM or create a new VM if it does not exist.

267
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,360
Okay.

268
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:18,160
Since this is coming up.

269
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,000
Now it's already up.

270
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,620
Anyways, a few important points that I want to add.

271
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:31,100
Compared to Windows user, you will see Windows user have will have option of many other boxes compared

272
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,980
to MacBook M1 and M2 chip.

273
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,280
The problem is actually the M1 and M2 chip.

274
00:15:36,290 --> 00:15:39,170
There are not many boxes available for this architecture.

275
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:47,510
So for we will be using these specific boxes that I have mentioned later in the Vagrant section once

276
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,700
you become proficient with Vagrant.

277
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,620
After Linux we have vagrant session.

278
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:55,190
Once you become proficient, then you can do your experiments.

279
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:57,820
But till then keep the boxes.

280
00:15:57,830 --> 00:16:01,250
Same name of the boxes as I have shown you now.

281
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:06,980
Keep in mind we have limited choice when it comes to M1 and M2 chip.

282
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:14,410
So do not worry too much about the commands that you have seen, the text, the code that you have seen.

283
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,620
You will be learning all that in detail later in Linux session.

284
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,540
You're going to get very proficient with command line in Wagner and we'll be learning a lot of Wagner

285
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:27,650
and then later we'll be doing batch scripting, we'll be doing cloud computing.

286
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:30,950
So it will take some time to become proficient with all this.

287
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:32,450
This is just the VM set up.

288
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,340
So take it easy, bring up the VM.

289
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,350
That's all we need to do for now.

290
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,670
All right, then.

291
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:39,350
That is all in this lecture.

292
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,180
I will see you in the next one.
