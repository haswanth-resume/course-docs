1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,740
Ah, let's see a few more cool sources of us about monitoring our accounts for threats.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:10,790
One is guard duty when we really talk about monitoring threats.

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:12,970
Think about our own operating system.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:19,030
How do we monitor or prevent the threats on our own computer or on on our own laptop?

5
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:26,680
We use some antivirus or Internet security tools on guard duty is almost similar to that for your e-mail

6
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,460
account.

7
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,990
And you really don't need to do much over here to just enable the guard duty so that it will start monitoring

8
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:39,780
your account for potential threats, so you just see enable guard duty and we'll check coutry logs,

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,940
which we have enabled the peak flow log.

10
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:49,290
If you enable the VPC flow log and even DNS log, so it will analyze your network and see if there is

11
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,490
any potential threat.

12
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,310
If there is some Bitcoin mining happening in your account and you get alerted on that, you can even

13
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:00,070
have connected with Lambretta functions, which can take some action on that.

14
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,100
So let's see how the service looks.

15
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,540
So you really don't need to worry on building for at least one month, one month, you have fruitier

16
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,730
30 days, so you can just start.

17
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:22,630
Guard duty, you just have to click on this, you see you have 30 days free guard duty, so enable guard

18
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:24,780
duty and you have to wait.

19
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,440
We don't have really any finding yet.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,910
It's going to take some time and it is based on machine learning automatically.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,710
It will be scanning for long and will develop an intelligence in seven to 14 days.

22
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:41,440
And then it will and understand what kind of infrastructure traffic comes in and goes out.

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:47,710
It will have a study and if it finds something unusual than your usual traffic, it will alert you.

24
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,220
Let's go to settings.

25
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,530
His cool down a bit, you see, you have an export option, you can export the finding for every six

26
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:04,770
hours or one hour or 15 minutes, any common weaknesses it will find and export it.

27
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,370
And you can configure an extra bucket where you want to store that output.

28
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:12,320
So, as I told you, it's going to take a lot of time for it.

29
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:16,700
So many days, seven days, 14 days to really generate all the right findings.

30
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:18,510
But we have some sample data.

31
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,040
We can check the sample data.

32
00:02:21,830 --> 00:02:23,150
Let's go to findings now.

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:33,600
And these are some sample data like unauthorized access to your three bucket penetration testing is

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,620
happening of interest.

35
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,220
Interesting tools.

36
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,700
Are there the Trojan unauthorized access to easy to back door entries?

37
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:48,370
We'll see cryptocurrency, if any, bitcoin mining is happening, so you can see such kind of unauthorized

38
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:53,230
and malicious activity in your account and then you can take action on that.

39
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,430
In the settings you have this list, you can also mention the IP address that you trust, you give the

40
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:07,710
list of IP address over here and then it will not generate any finding for those IP addresses.

41
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,590
Or you want to say that malicious IP IP addresses are there.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,660
You can add the threat threat list.

43
00:03:14,670 --> 00:03:18,120
So guard duty will keep finding those IP addresses.

44
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:25,840
Let's check some documentation on this, really, there is nothing much in terms of administration in

45
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,080
this.

46
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,210
Everything is done by God.

47
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,630
It uses machine learning.

48
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:36,670
But if you want to know what are the IP addresses that you are the trusted IPS or the threat IBBS and

49
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:37,630
what are the findings?

50
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:38,860
How to understand the findings.

51
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,570
And you can check the documentation you have the concepts and terminologies.

52
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:48,730
What are the findings, suppression rules, understanding the finding, finding details.

53
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,100
The finding somebody will have things like finding I.D. severity, which region account ID.

54
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,220
Access key details as three details.

55
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,810
Unusual protocol.

56
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,660
What does that mean?

57
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,760
What is anomalous behavior?

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:12,540
So really not much in documentation.

59
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,589
Also, if you go through the step by step and spend some time with guard duty, you should be able to

60
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,070
understand most of the threats and then you can understand how to deal with them.

61
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:31,260
You can keep the findings on, but if you are already close to 30 days, you want to disable it, then

62
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:35,630
you can disable the findings, you can suspend the guard duty.

63
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,520
Suspend means it will just stop the monitoring.

64
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,700
It will not generate a new findings.

65
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:41,940
But if you disable.

66
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,550
You will also lose any existing findings and any configuration Saltville Disabler.

67
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,180
So we can come back later and enable it and play more with guard duty.

68
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:58,990
Next, we are seeing Volf Web application firewall.

69
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:03,880
We already have seen some firewalls, we have seen security group, we have seen NCCL.

70
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:07,390
We also talked about some third party firewall.

71
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,570
You can purchase them from Marketplace and use it as a threat protection layer.

72
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,950
This firewall is very different.

73
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,230
This is about your applications.

74
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:23,350
You can put this firewall on in front of cloud front or application load balancer, or even if you're

75
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,950
using API Gateway, Amazon API Gateway, you can use that.

76
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,760
Also, there are some very common rules you can set up or you can set up your own rule that you don't

77
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,520
want any communication coming from in the world from some IP address or a secure injection.

78
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,380
You want to prevent or any such malicious code coming into you all.

79
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,480
You want to prevent that blocking filter it.

80
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:45,670
You can use that for that.

81
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:52,500
There are always top 10 security risk and they're already managed rule in for that, you can use it

82
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,350
and you can prevent those top 10 security risk like ESKIL injection cross site scripting, or you can

83
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,620
even create your own rules.

84
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:00,960
So let's go and check.

85
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,050
How does that work?

86
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,190
So you can search for wife and that's to solve this together, actually, Wolf, and she'll.

87
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:18,140
So if you use this together, you can have a firewall on your application and you can also be safe from

88
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:21,940
the DOS attacks, basic shield will be any reasonable.

89
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:27,440
But if you want to go with Advanced Shield, there are charges for it and we'll talk about that after

90
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,950
we are done with this stuff.

91
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,310
So let's go to Ralph.

92
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,580
So, again, involved there is no here, are there the rules are charged, so if you want to skip this

93
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,040
exercise, you can skip it also.

94
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,480
But I'm going to set a very simple rules.

95
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,970
So let's create web, atheel.

96
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,710
And let's give some name, I will see we profile.

97
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:53,320
That's.

98
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:01,170
You can select here which resource you want to use it for cloud front or you want to use it for load

99
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:05,420
balancer, EPA Gateway or replace absence, you can select the region where you want to create it.

100
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:11,450
And then you can add the resource here itself if you want, or you can add them later.

101
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:16,870
Also, as of now, I don't have any application load balancer or anything, but we can create that later.

102
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,760
Also, let's click on Next now about the rules over here.

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:26,200
So you have managed rules, you can create your own rules, but let's see this managed rules.

104
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:34,880
So mismanaged rules, you know, that A.W. release provides you to use like admin protection, you can

105
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,370
read about this anonymous IP list.

106
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:41,300
So there are some IPIS that you should prevent access from.

107
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:49,640
And Linux operating system ESKIL databases to provide to prevent ESKIL injections.

108
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:51,260
You can select those rules.

109
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,360
What you feel comfortable if you want more advanced rule.

110
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,030
The rules are also sold through a marketplace.

111
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:07,560
So cyber security cloud managed rules, so you can subscribe that in the marketplace, you can purchase

112
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,840
that a five.

113
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:16,680
And there's so many rules like that that you can purchase unsubscribe from the marketplace, and we'll

114
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,000
just keep these few rules.

115
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:28,640
So we selected these three rules, we just select all the three, we want these rules and I'm going

116
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,270
to say next.

117
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,280
You can decide the priority which you want to evaluate first or later, I'll keep that as it is.

118
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:37,890
Go next.

119
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:42,690
So cloud watch Metrick will be created for these things.

120
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,710
Let's go next.

121
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:49,210
Review all this and you can see create Web Essien.

122
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,510
We have of afros created over here, and if you want to, can attach to load balancer, so let's go

123
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:00,180
to Ecuador to launch an application load balancer.

124
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:05,290
You go to target group first al Qaeda target group.

125
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,180
Instances.

126
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,390
I just see my target group.

127
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:15,810
And just for the sake of creating it so I can show you how you can attach these rules.

128
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:24,240
I was create an empty target group, go to load balancer, load balancer, application load balancer.

129
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,420
To fill in the detail, go next.

130
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,300
That's a complete security group.

131
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,970
Go next.

132
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,510
Configure routing sender to this target group.

133
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:52,600
So we have an application load balancer created how we can go to work, and it is only for application

134
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,070
load balancer, not for classic.

135
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,540
So you can go to your rule.

136
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:02,620
Associated eatables resources.

137
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:08,610
And you can see adorableness resource, you can find your application load balancer and you can see

138
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:14,030
add now these rules will be applied to our application load balancer.

139
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,490
So, for example, like we have put a skin injection.

140
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:23,190
So it's going to prevent any activity through coming through the wall, which is trying to do a skill

141
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,790
injection.

142
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:28,790
To create these rules, you really need to be an expert in the application security.

143
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:35,370
If you want to include your own rules or you can buy some popular rules or subscribe for popular rules

144
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,690
from the marketplace.

145
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:43,620
OK, so once you're done with that deleteriously related application load balancer, the next service

146
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,920
will be seeing here in the same dashboard is Eatables Shield.

147
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:56,690
Eatables Shield protects you from do those attacks, so there is a basic shield or any ways enable in

148
00:10:56,690 --> 00:11:03,080
your account, but you also have an option to subscribe for an advanced shield, which is three thousand

149
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:04,180
dollars per month.

150
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:12,680
So don't try to enable that for big enterprises, big companies, it's no big deal because this regular

151
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,480
those attacks on big enterprises.

152
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:17,750
So I think that's all worth doing it.

153
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:25,180
It also gives you a dashboard and the plus point of going for advice is not just about the protection

154
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:31,990
from the reader's attack in even if you already have an advanced shield in the details, attack happens

155
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:35,170
and you have too many resources that gets created.

156
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:41,200
The eatables will not charge you for all those resources if you have shield advanced enabled.

157
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:47,920
It will also show you the dashboard, also the global dashboard last two weeks, what happened, you

158
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:55,870
can see 157 and BP is largest packett attack for ninety nine GB, pIace largest Bitterroots.

159
00:11:55,870 --> 00:12:01,030
So it will show you the common attacks that are happening and how you can prevent yourself very easily

160
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:03,380
by just enabling the advance shield.

161
00:12:04,090 --> 00:12:05,820
So it's just about enabling, that's all.

162
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:13,150
Which is very simple to do, but don't do it if you have a free trade account, but if it's an enterprise,

163
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:19,690
I really recommend you turn this feature on so you can be protected from very, very common and regularly

164
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:21,070
happening Budos attacks.

165
00:12:22,530 --> 00:12:30,030
So coming back to a sleights, well, we talked about Vav, and if you enable eatables wife rules,

166
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:36,690
then you would be protected from the top down oos vulnerability's injection broker authentication and

167
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:39,300
all the top 10 attacks.

168
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:43,060
You'll be safe from those attack if you're using Vav Web application firewall.

169
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:46,380
These are very common attacks that keep happening regularly.

170
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,750
And you can also go and subscribe for better rules from established marketplace.

171
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,780
Or you can write your own rules also for details protection.

172
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,370
You have established Shiel.

173
00:12:57,970 --> 00:13:04,450
So the standard one is to enable the advanced, as I told you, it's three thousand dollars a month.

174
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:08,770
And if you're a big enterprise organization, then you can really go for it.

175
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,600
One more thing you can do for the lost production is go for Syrian OUTFRONT.

176
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:21,230
Which we discussed, which we have done the project Eatables Refactoring, that we use the content delivery

177
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:29,920
network CDN, if you use in the request, will be coming to your CDN or A.W. Education and Illuminists

178
00:13:29,930 --> 00:13:34,700
will have all the kinds of security to prevent doors to its education.

179
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:39,560
So you can use that CDN and you can get benefited with A.W. security.

180
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:46,990
Also, if you put off, you can put the rules on CDN so everything gets filtered out at your content

181
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:52,150
delivery network, a student education, and you don't get any threat or you get very, very little

182
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:57,190
threat to your infrastructure directly to a load balancer, to your student students or in your VPC.

183
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,570
So imagine the threats would be filtered at so many level students.

184
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,320
There is a Vafamehr there that comes to your load balancer there.

185
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:12,100
You can have life and security groups and subnets and any NCCL then security group for the instances,

186
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,640
NCCL for the private instance or for the private subnets.

187
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:17,470
And then you have firewalls.

188
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:23,080
Still have an amazing track prediction layer, if you use all these sources that we discussed throughout

189
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,970
this eatables security session.

190
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:31,300
So we you do those attacks happening, Raffi's there, the have advanced will enable cloud front, it

191
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:36,790
will be neutralized and then the traffic comes to your load balancer and at the load balancer also you

192
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,080
can have the virus.

193
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,700
Things get filtered over there.

194
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:44,440
It's in the public subnet will have any and then the traffic is out to your private subnets where you

195
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:50,080
will have your databases, which will be again protected by any special security groups.

196
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,200
And also you make sure your data is encrypted.

197
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:58,780
So details protection plus all the kinds of security that you get if you use all these sources in a

198
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,840
sequence in the proper order.

199
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,390
All right, so that's all in this video.

200
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:07,650
Water resources you created, please clean those resources.

201
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,500
Thank you very much for watching these videos.

202
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,630
I'll see you in the next one.
