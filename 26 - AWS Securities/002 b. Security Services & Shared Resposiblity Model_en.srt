1
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,410
So I have logged into my eatables management console.

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:11,180
And let's check your security, identity and compliance services.

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,720
So you see, there are quite many services, I am cognito, secrets, manager, guard, duty inspector,

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,890
Amazon Masih.

5
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,530
Van, she'll established firewall manager, detective.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:27,130
These are some new so there are some new services also.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,960
But you will not see few sources that we discussed in the introduction, like eatables organization

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,970
or config or clout through the intersection of management and governance, also VPC, if you talk about

9
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,880
it in network and content delivery.

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:52,870
So this a separate section for security services, because they are very specific for the security purpose,

11
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,540
but the other services like organization.

12
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,890
This is a service to group multiple eatables account, and there so many things you can do, plus you

13
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:03,170
can implement security policies also there.

14
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:09,200
I also config, which creates which has the entire configuration of variables account, you can keep

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,920
track of every configurations, plus you can set rules also which can find out like if Porton data,

16
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,660
for example, is open, it will alert you, oh, can you fix that automatically?

17
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:26,750
So services that are purely for security purposes, you will see that in the security section, but

18
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:31,910
services that are used for other purposes also you will see them in a different section.

19
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,720
So let's go through all the services of one by one that we discussed in introduction.

20
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,460
Understand?

21
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:46,160
Understand what they provide and how to use it to secure our account and our infrastructure.

22
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:54,220
Oedema, security, best practices, that's where our focus is going to be the best practices covering

23
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:57,070
all the security services out of the scope of this.

24
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:03,200
But nonetheless, we're going to cover so many homeless services for security and we'll see what are

25
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,020
the best practices, how we can leverage it to secure our infrastructure, our pipeline, what are we

26
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:09,410
using?

27
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:09,979
Developes.

28
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,220
There could be a misconception, you may be also having it, that if I put something on eatables cloud,

29
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,010
the security is really a tablas responsibility.

30
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,330
I don't need to do anything.

31
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,770
And that's very wrong.

32
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:34,120
This is a shared responsibility model, so definitely the blues has their own responsibility of securing

33
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,180
the data center, securing your infrastructure physically.

34
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:45,030
Which is at the region level, availability zone locations are easy to instant in the computer.

35
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,590
We talk about we launch easy to instance, it's in my account.

36
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:50,650
Can someone access that from their account?

37
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,680
No, it cannot be done.

38
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,380
That's eatables responsibility.

39
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,640
For an example.

40
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,190
I would even already has databases or the private subnets that you create in the VPC.

41
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,340
So it's eatables responsibility to preserve it.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,920
But we also have a lot of responsibility in our head.

43
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,350
Eatables is going to give you all that security.

44
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:13,840
But for example, if you launch an easy to instance and if you see all traffic in security group is

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,830
allowed from anywhere, anybody can access any part of your receipt, for instance.

46
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,200
Now, that falls in your hand like that, there are so many things that falls in the customer's hand

47
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,400
and this is a same diagram which is in eatables documentation.

48
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,620
I have not made that.

49
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,740
This is Eatables shared responsibility model.

50
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,160
So if you see what are the responsibility in our customer data, the data that we put, let's see,

51
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,680
we put some data in every bucket encrypting that data or making sure it's not available for everyone

52
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,440
to be accessed.

53
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,630
That's our responsibility.

54
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:52,400
Platform, Application, Identity and Access Management IAM.

55
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:54,800
We have to create the Amusa.

56
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,720
We have to decide what permission it has.

57
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,890
The password offered these us that we are hosting.

58
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,580
Security securing it at no secured with security group or VBC National and even the operating system

59
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,400
Lewis firewall.

60
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,470
It's our responsibility.

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:13,890
So operating system, network and firewall.

62
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,160
Side data encryption and data integrity.

63
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,240
So when you are pushing the data and the data is going from, you know, let's say your data center

64
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,260
to a robust cloud data center, so the data which is going in transit should be encrypted.

65
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,780
You have to encrypt it and send it or Sarasate encryption.

66
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:40,370
Sajida in-transit should be encrypted data, which is stored on A.W. should be encrypted.

67
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,970
And we decide on those factors, which matters a lot.

68
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,130
So these are the areas will be working in security is really multiple layers.

69
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:00,750
It's not like one thing that you secure and you're safe and sound.

70
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,470
Security is created multiple layers.

71
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,080
Not think about a big house, right?

72
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,320
With the big house, with a main gate.

73
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:13,710
Then you have the door and then you have rooms in the doors.

74
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:21,330
In the rooms you have safe lockers, which is password protected or biometric inside that you have your

75
00:05:21,330 --> 00:05:22,000
valuables.

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,980
There are so many levels that a thief has to break to get your valuable data, which is stored in a

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:36,300
safe, which is in a room protected by a door lock with that and then a main door and then the gate.

78
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:42,750
So you can protect at some level you could be having security guards, watchmen, CCTV cameras.

79
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:52,450
Biometric locks with which opens with your keys, similar with security, is multiple layers.

80
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:58,440
So if we take example, everything is secure, you have a secure VPC, you have everything control,

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,990
everything is you know, the security groups are in control.

82
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:02,250
You have the key to log in.

83
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,270
Everything is in your hand.

84
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,030
But if your identity access management, you create a user and it's access keys exposed.

85
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:15,870
So the cyber criminals can use that access quiggin the control in your account and they can make all

86
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,530
the changes.

87
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:24,120
They can get whatever they want if they get access to your entire console or you can think of the other

88
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,960
way, that is secure, but your network is not secure.

89
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,640
So you have to secure things at multiple layers.

90
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,150
So we can just start with identity access management.

91
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:39,390
We already did some part of it in political sites, video like multifactor authentication, securing

92
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,230
our route user.

93
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,180
And so we are going to go more than that.

94
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:45,360
We are going to get into policies detective controls.

95
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:53,180
Like using cloud watch for alerts, eatables trusted adviser sources with those infrastructure protection,

96
00:06:53,790 --> 00:07:00,270
protecting your network through private subnets in the VBC National Security Group or Vav or SHIELD

97
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:08,250
or Guard duty data protection, you know, encrypting your data in transit and addressed incident response.

98
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,540
And you did everything.

99
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,020
But, you know, the incident happens.

100
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:14,770
So how do you get alerted about that and what actions you are going to take?

101
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,240
What are the sources that we can use to respond to an incident?

102
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,180
And also we're going to talk about application protection.

103
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:27,510
So all the sources that we are going to see will be falling in this four and five areas.

104
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:36,390
So along with whatever you're doing in this session, I'm going to also share some reinvent videos and

105
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:42,630
documentation with you on these services, which can really make you really master of these services,

106
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:48,750
for example, and different policies of how erm how to get really advanced in that, you know, expertise

107
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:58,250
in that or Adidas production by using she got due to different services and encryption using CMS.

108
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:01,670
So I will a lot of reinvent videos with you.

109
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,230
I really, really recommend you go through those videos and practice those things so you get very good

110
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,990
hands on these services.

111
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:13,530
Plus also throughout the session I'll be sharing documentation with you.

112
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,310
You can bookmark those and then you can use them whenever you want.

113
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,310
So let's get started with our Fausto's, which is an.
