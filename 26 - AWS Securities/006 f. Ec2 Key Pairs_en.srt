1
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:05,740
OK, next time I'm going to talk directly about easy to keep here.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,530
This is also very short video.

3
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,640
You can create cheapish whenever you want.

4
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:20,020
You can attach those key to when, when when you're launching Dunston's and you get the private key,

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:27,430
you use that to log in the keys with you, with the public keys, with a W.S. maybe for compliance reason

6
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:28,300
not.

7
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:34,780
Maybe it happens so many times because of compliance, you cannot allow anybody else, some third party

8
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,930
provider to create the key players.

9
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,370
You should create them public and private key.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,500
And then you put your own public in your account so you will have only the public and private key will

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,120
be with you from the beginning.

12
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:53,750
Now, no, if you're thinking that it always keeps the private key for itself, that's wrong.

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,010
You can check the database compliancy no wants to keep is created to give you the private key.

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,620
And they don't hold any private key.

15
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,060
They don't have access to your to instance through Secich or RTP.

16
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,740
That's what they're in the company in their compliance.

17
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:10,050
But you also have to follow your own compliance.

18
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,640
And based on your compliance, you're not allowed to create keepers uneatable.

19
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,490
So you can create key public private both and you can upload your key and you can use it.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,050
So private keys only with you.

21
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:29,400
Also sending private key to it all from an unencrypted channel.

22
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,770
And putting them in the pen drives and moving into the different system.

23
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:34,830
It's not really recommended.

24
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,720
You should keep it in a safe place and that safe place should be probably some tool or something password

25
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,270
protected.

26
00:01:42,170 --> 00:01:43,290
That's the recommendation.

27
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:49,930
OK, so let's go to the console and see how we can create our own keys and upload it to establish.

28
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,040
Salguero, easy to.

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,900
Now, see, this is more of compliance than regular security.

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:00,920
OK, so let's go to keepers.

31
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:08,810
I clean my keys, OK, so we can create keeper.

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:11,650
I click on that and you know that's the problem, right?

33
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,040
Because of compliance, we should not create the key here.

34
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:15,790
All right.

35
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,780
So I'm going to cancel that.

36
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,370
I will keep it on my local machine, on my laptop and upload the public key.

37
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,370
Now, you can do that in the actions.

38
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:26,450
You can import Kebir.

39
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,980
So I'm going to use get back to my keeper, it has the tool as such, kigen.

40
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,860
OK, so I created a keeper.

41
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,590
It's in my don't necessarily directory of my user.

42
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,480
All right.

43
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,040
So I can just see Alice.

44
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,390
Anyways, I'm already in my home territory.

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:59,050
And so I should see here should be going to doctors as such, and so we see the public, we see the

46
00:02:59,050 --> 00:02:59,500
private.

47
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:08,350
OK, so I look back to my public key and read this and I'm going to copy this public key.

48
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:16,460
Right now, if you see the matching private keys in my system, it's not with us.

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,490
I'm going to see action import Quebecer, give Keepit a name.

50
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:25,660
Maybe we profile logging key.

51
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,350
And you get this bastard.

52
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:34,000
Or you can just browsing and just upload your public.

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:37,260
OK, this is the public, not the private key.

54
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:46,800
All right, so that's where I have now the public debate, I'm launching the instance I can select Diski,

55
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,910
the private keys with me.

56
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,620
I can use that private key to login.

57
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,570
I can really say eye to search.

58
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:58,070
And I doubt I'm ordering such fake ID and you should clear it with a different name.

59
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,830
OK, just for recognizing which key matching otherwise, you know, it was just the idea.

60
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,430
And this quality here, you may be having the confusion, right.

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,900
So you the key and know again the user hatriot IP and you login right.

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,430
Like that.

63
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,019
So better again.

64
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,670
Maybe Creative Director Ecology's.

65
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,690
And I will move.

66
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:36,360
That idea underscored Odyssey to Keyes directly with name profile, hyphen Log-in, hyphen Ky Dot Pam.

67
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:40,090
Go to my case directly.

68
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:45,460
So it's easy to recognize that keys matched with that key named.

69
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:52,240
And then I can password-protected protect this directly or maybe use some tool that I put the keys and

70
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,160
password protect them.

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,190
Right.

72
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:57,940
So that was about compliance on the key, Piers.

73
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,180
And that's all in this video and next video, we'll be talking about encryption keys.

74
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,200
So wrap this up and join me in the next video.
