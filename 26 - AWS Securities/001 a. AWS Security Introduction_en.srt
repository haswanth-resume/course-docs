00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:14,290
Welcome to the AWB Securities Project.

2
00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:18,950
In this project, we are going to practice and implement AWB securities.

3
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:20,890
What does it really mean?

4
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,890
We'll understand that in a moments.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,030
But as of now, I can tell you this, having securities concepts on your resume will really boost your

6
00:00:32,030 --> 00:00:32,810
confidence.

7
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:36,170
And the power of your resume itself.

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:40,720
So let's understand a few things about this project.

9
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:48,880
So this project is for awareness, encouragement, and I want to equip you with the right knowledge.

10
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:55,030
Yeah, this is more about implementing security in all the other projects you have done previously,

11
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,460
which used A.W. as services.

12
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:07,000
So this is not like a wholesome project, but it's more like cherry on the cake for you and for your

13
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,490
resume, of course, which will, of course, benefit the organization which is hiring you.

14
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:19,990
So when I say awareness, that's because the biggest problem I see in the security is people are not

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,040
aware they make mistakes, which could be very expensive.

16
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:30,550
So this session is going to kind of enlighten you that, hey, there are these kinds of attacks and

17
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:36,190
you have so many tools with you that you can use and prevent those attacks.

18
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:43,390
Also, I want to encourage you to learn more in the security as more and more we shift towards cloud

19
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,000
computing, the more we are getting exposed.

20
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,260
So let's see different kinds of attacks.

21
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,410
Well, various kinds of attacks that you see nowadays here, there are just few of them distributed

22
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:06,890
denial of service where someone attacks you or your organization infrastructure to bring it down.

23
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:11,990
Or slow it down, so here the user will be affected, really.

24
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:19,120
And in turn, your business gets affected man in the middle attack, which is more like that between

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:24,340
the two phone lines, like we see we see in the movies that the phone gets tapped.

26
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:31,180
Similar to that, in sending data from point A to point B and there is a tap in the middle C, which

27
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:36,600
listens all the communication or has all the communication phishing, which you are aware about it.

28
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,820
We hear so many stories nowadays about phishing.

29
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:49,740
Drive by attack, which is mostly used to spread malware where a cyber criminal will inject some malicious

30
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:55,110
script into insecure websites like you have hosted a website that's really insecure.

31
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,930
So cyber criminals can use this website to plan attack on the user of the site.

32
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:07,350
So if you if your user uses, you know, accessing your website, the malware gets installed in the

33
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:09,390
computer or on their smartphone.

34
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,720
Basswood attack, as the name itself said, attack to get your password, and then there are various

35
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,720
methods in that really going in depth on this is really out of the scope of the session.

36
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:27,280
This for your awareness that there are attacks, lots of lots of attacks like that, and there are few

37
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:27,730
more.

38
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:37,070
As fuel injection attack or cross site scripting, eavesdropping attack or malware attack, SQL injection,

39
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:42,440
where a cyber criminal will use malicious Ezekial code.

40
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:50,240
So like through a website sending ESKIL injections, which gets inserted into the database, the database

41
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:55,370
runs those queries and which may reveal a lot of information about the database or even destroy the

42
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,270
database itself.

43
00:03:56,990 --> 00:04:02,090
Cross site scripting, where the attacker aims to execute malicious scripts in a Web browser of the

44
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:02,910
victim itself.

45
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:10,070
These attacks occurs when victim visits the websites or the application that executes such kind of code

46
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,170
eavesdropping attack, which is really a theft of information.

47
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:17,640
It's also sniffing or snooping.

48
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:22,340
So here the attackers take the advantage of unsecure networks.

49
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:29,500
And malware attack, of course, where the cyber criminals, the attackers will inject some malware

50
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,980
like Trojan Horse and like that, there really many, many more attacks.

51
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,680
This is just an awareness that they that there is bad, bad, bad world out there which is waiting for

52
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,880
you to make a mistake.

53
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,160
So you'll ask me, what do we do really about it?

54
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,160
Well.

55
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,720
Stay alert.

56
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,190
You should keep security always in your mind, if you remember throughout the projects that he used

57
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:07,970
or where he used a cloud computing platform, we never exposed our security group or we kept our key

58
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,690
secret.

59
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:15,840
I did not wanted you to expose your access, your secret to so many places where we keep security.

60
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,420
We kept security in mind, but there are so many more things.

61
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,370
And really doing security on airplanes is very, very easy as compared to any other place.

62
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:28,540
So being a Davos, what do we really do about it being a diva?

63
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,810
So you have to work hand in hand with the security professionals.

64
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:41,410
I'm not saying that you go out there and you take all the responsibility in your hand, but everyone

65
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:45,680
plays their role in security, so as developes plays a role in the security.

66
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,120
Also.

67
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:53,770
And if you're interested more, you can gain more knowledge and security by learning penetration testing,

68
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,910
ethical hacking, cyber security.

69
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:05,020
So if you're wondering, are we really talking about def sec ops here, you can say in a sense, yes,

70
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,670
I know that's not such a confident statement and there is reason behind it.

71
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,030
Dempsey is a quantum.

72
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,000
We don't know where.

73
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:19,220
I really don't know where it got invented the stone, and there's so many people who don't agree with

74
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:22,030
this terminology and some people agree with this terminology.

75
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:29,930
I stand on the side of not agreeing with this terminology, because when you create these kinds of terms

76
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:37,100
in divorce, divorce is already a philosophy of unifying development and operations together.

77
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:43,490
But then we're creating more teams in that we are seeing dev ops, cloud ops, no ops.

78
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:51,160
Well, this really confuses the audience more, and the audience could be you and me, the customer

79
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,990
declined the idea organization.

80
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,030
So do I go with the devil?

81
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:55,880
Can you do.

82
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,820
Should I go with the deficit office candidate?

83
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,890
So just sample this, I'll show you some information from RedHat and EWR and you compare the difference

84
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,390
yourself.

85
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:14,730
So this is from RedHat, what is cops, I don't want to read all of it, but I wanted you to read a

86
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:15,570
few things.

87
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:24,010
Whether you call it a dev ops or dev ops, it has always been ideal to include security as an integral

88
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,350
part of entire app lifecycle.

89
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:34,050
So not such a confident statement right there, they are saying, is about implementing security in

90
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:38,280
the divorce pipeline and that's what you can understand for now.

91
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,150
A few more things.

92
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:45,560
Deficit jobs means thinking about application and infrastructure security from the start.

93
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,650
Now, if you're on cloud computing, you're talking about infrastructure.

94
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,440
You can see cloud security also then.

95
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:57,830
If you're talking about application security, then there is application security already in place.

96
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,130
To me, it's really about integrating security in Davos.

97
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,950
That is all that was about.

98
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:08,040
RedHat, let's see, about eight of us.

99
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,150
So on this site.

100
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:17,350
So Smith, Schmidt, I don't even know how to pronounce it, Julia, I'm so sorry about it.

101
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:18,950
He's a.

102
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,370
I can call him Stefán, that's his first name, so Stefán is a chief information security officer in

103
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:30,090
W.S. and he does not agree with this terminology.

104
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:31,810
Even I don't agree with this terminology.

105
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:37,020
This is what I really object is this notion that some people have.

106
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:42,350
That there is security development and operations and they are separate.

107
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,530
So it's not separate.

108
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:48,320
We really don't need to use a new terminology over there.

109
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,670
There used to be a word water rug to divorce.

110
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,490
If you just Google it rucked dev ops.

111
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:59,310
That's what we used to call it initially when it started integrating security with divorce.

112
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,720
But then desktops work.

113
00:09:01,950 --> 00:09:03,180
So, no, not really.

114
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,130
I really don't want to confuse you more.

115
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:11,190
You can be on the side of agreeing with the terminology or not agreeing with any you have to keep in

116
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:11,640
mind.

117
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,610
So there was devlopment, right?

118
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,560
Then there was operations.

119
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:23,680
And we streamlined together, it became divorce.

120
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,960
Our developers, our operations team, working together hand in hand, gives you the philosophy of unifying

121
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,220
development and operations team.

122
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:37,800
We discuss that several times throughout our projects and have created a nice video in our portal,

123
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:41,870
in our YouTube channel, an animated video of what is developed.

124
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,690
If you still have confusion, you can go through that video.

125
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,350
You we get confused because people confuse us more, right?

126
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:53,360
So there is no security in Middleford so Dev set off.

127
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,710
That's how you get the terminology dev ops.

128
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,460
So.

129
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,620
Being a divorce, now, working hand in hand with security, you can take that as an objective.

130
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:08,350
And if you're if you're doing that, if you're implementing security in your divorce pipelines, in

131
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:13,870
your infrastructure, then you if someone asks you, are you doing sick hours, then you can say, yes,

132
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:14,380
I am.

133
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,630
But for now, to be very, very specific, what we are doing over here is doing security on eatables

134
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:22,980
cloud.

135
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,630
We are learning security concepts.

136
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,570
From EWR, the eatables sources we are using to implement the security so we can be safe from those

137
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,980
attacks that we are discussing.

138
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:38,560
So let's see what are the sources that we are going to use?

139
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:48,980
In EWR, starting with I am eatables organization, eatables trusted adviser, CM's in easy to keep

140
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:52,070
elastic load balancer with a secure connection.

141
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,650
So I am you already aware about it.

142
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:59,950
But we are going to talk about a few more good practices in that established organization, which is

143
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:05,900
grouping of multiple accounts and how we can implement security over their trusted advisor, which is

144
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:10,820
isn't completely replacement service, which will give you information security information or other

145
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,360
information.

146
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,010
Also about your account.

147
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,070
Eatables Account Kemmis is for encryption.

148
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:21,760
We you create keys and store it in CM's, which should be used to encrypt our data.

149
00:11:22,670 --> 00:11:27,200
We are going to get into detail on all these services one by one and implement them.

150
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:33,300
In our eatables account and so as the same thing you will be doing in your projects also.

151
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:44,140
More services from eatables, again, eatables inspector, which is a service to scan vulnerability

152
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,230
in your network and in your operating systems.

153
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,440
VPC We already did that.

154
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,910
We did projects on VPC.

155
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:59,650
So you talk specifically about security group NaCl and VPC flew logs Clowe Trail, which is going to

156
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:06,130
store all the information, all the EPA calls, any changes happen or any EPA calls that goes through

157
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,980
your account will get recorded in Cottrill eatables config, which is really expensive service.

158
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:15,070
But what an amazing service, really.

159
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,830
You know, it can distort the configuration of your entire eatables account into one place and can also

160
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,860
show you how things are changing.

161
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:33,810
All right, other services, guard duty, eatables, wife, eatables, shield, eatables, can't think

162
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:44,790
guard duty is more like you can think of a security guard or a patrol police like an antivirus of your

163
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:45,550
account?

164
00:12:45,570 --> 00:12:47,100
Not exactly, but for understanding.

165
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:55,410
As of now in a the office of the application firewall firewall for your application, not network firewall

166
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,630
lets the security group is a network firewall.

167
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,890
Nakulan PVCs network firewall is on your application.

168
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,810
We'll see how that works.

169
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,890
Eatables Shield, which is to prevent the DOS attack.

170
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:17,930
And if you go for the big vision, the Advanced Shield, it's very expensive, but it can prevent many,

171
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:20,510
many, many, many needless attacks for you and also.

172
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,880
If you happen to be a victim of Rudolph's attack and you have Eatables Shield advanced enabled, you

173
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,210
don't need to pay for that resources, it is going to refund that to you.

174
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:31,620
OK.

175
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,170
I need a misconfiguration.

176
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,470
We're going to talk once again.

177
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:42,560
Along with that, I'm going to take you through the a few of the data security services like Macie and

178
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,570
few the myriad of security services.

179
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,910
So all the best, good luck, I'm going to now go through all these security sources one by one and

180
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,830
implemented in our eatables account.

181
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,940
So join me on the Wisconsin.
