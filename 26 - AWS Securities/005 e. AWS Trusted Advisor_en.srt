1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:07,460
A.W. is a trusted adviser, as the name says, it's an adviser here.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,800
You really don't need to do much.

3
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:11,830
You just need to use the service.

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,480
It will give you advice on cost optimization.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:21,310
You know, maybe you have some easy does just that is not used for a very, very long time or you have

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:23,040
some dubious volume that are unused.

7
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:27,160
So it will alert you, hey, you have resources, you're not using it now.

8
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:29,670
You can delete it and save some money performance.

9
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:29,880
Right.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:33,690
You have too many users coming in and accessing a particular service.

11
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,020
Right.

12
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:35,920
But it's not optimum.

13
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,970
And the most requests are slowing down, failing.

14
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,130
So it will give recommendation or no tweet, tweet this or tuneless find you on this security.

15
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:46,510
That's where our attention is.

16
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,630
OK, I really like the service.

17
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:53,470
I don't need anybody else to tell me what to do or what not to do.

18
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,510
I the source will tell me, hey, you know, there is support.

19
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,420
This is crazily open and you should better take a look at that or your access keys are exposed to the

20
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,080
public.

21
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,060
It's in the GitHub public repository.

22
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,500
So it will tell you that.

23
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,040
Really.

24
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,350
Yeah, it will scan for the public repositories also and find if there is any access keys and, you

25
00:01:14,350 --> 00:01:14,980
know, hello, alert you.

26
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,300
Hey, your access is exposed.

27
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,530
Amazing.

28
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:17,890
Right now.

29
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:21,730
So many recommendations that it gives for fault tolerance for service limits.

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,800
We are more interested in security.

31
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:25,780
Let's check this source.

32
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,420
So let's just search for trusted adviser, let's click on it.

33
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,400
And it is cost optimization, performance security.

34
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:44,370
And so if there is any Élodie to show you, I don't have any such problems.

35
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:48,360
So it's not alerting me security says Amazon.

36
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,520
eBay's public snapshot you don't have.

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,240
It's a green check.

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,070
So you know you're good.

39
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,720
Don't have a public snapshot that can be seen by everyone.

40
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,120
OK, I'm as an artist public.

41
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,050
Sure that's not.

42
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:01,990
There are other things is a question mark that Amazon has bucket permission.

43
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,820
It's not checking.

44
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,220
Let's see that question mark you can read when it will alert you on why it will work and why it's not

45
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,820
alerting you.

46
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,890
Amuse MFA en route account.

47
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:12,240
Right.

48
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,080
There's a question mark.

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,850
So we need to take care of these things.

50
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,170
Right.

51
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,570
Security group specific board is unrestricted.

52
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,780
You have some security port that is unrestricted.

53
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,640
OK, you better work it out.

54
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,920
But if you go down, these things are great out, OK, which are very, very important.

55
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:32,280
Checks exposed axis keys.

56
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,400
I really recommend you turn this feature on how well you to upgrade for a plan, you know, upgrade

57
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,720
and you have to start paying for it.

58
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,490
And there are different plans.

59
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,460
It's basically the support plan.

60
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,680
OK, so you have basic developer level, business level and enterprise level for big enterprise.

61
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:56,200
It's not a big problem is not big money for them are starting from fifteen thousand dollars per month.

62
00:02:56,210 --> 00:03:00,600
This is for enterprise, but it gives a lot of recommendation for Enterprise.

63
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,100
It's fine.

64
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,780
You know, you can even enable business level, OK.

65
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,110
Hundred dollars per month.

66
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:15,740
Really no big deal for, you know, small organization developer and startups, you know, don't want

67
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,160
to invest.

68
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,290
But I really recommend in on business plan.

69
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:27,230
Because there's really so many things in this that we use, we consume the services, Vito says it's

70
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,660
not always possible to follow all the best practices.

71
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,690
So trusted adviser can keep alerting us.

72
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,150
And it's not only just about those recommendations, you know, that you get the customer service documentation,

73
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:39,870
white paper.

74
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:47,180
24 by seven, access to cloud support engineers via email, chat, phone, it will be definitely much

75
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:51,010
better in enterprise jindall guidance 24 hours.

76
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:53,930
And so it's also good for startups.

77
00:03:55,050 --> 00:04:00,630
Maybe you're using an account that already has a business plan or enterprise plan, a check that, you

78
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:05,010
know, imagine that you already have these many recommendations, maybe you're not even using it.

79
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:13,830
OK, again, checking the preference section, you can give the email addresses so you get weekly mail

80
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:19,279
notification that trade preferences for this week, you know, you should do this, this, this, this,

81
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:19,529
this.

82
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:21,089
And, you know, you can follow the listings.

83
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,460
So really nothing much to do over here, just need to go for the business plan, what plan you prefer

84
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:34,510
enablers, give them a notification, you can keep watching it, you can give your notifications, check

85
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:40,180
trusted adviser documentation for more details, what all it can do, how you can what will be the best

86
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,090
support plan for you?

87
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,820
You can contact the support and discuss with them and get the right plan for you.

88
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:49,160
So that is all in this one I see in the next video.
