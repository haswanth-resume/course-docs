1
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,930
OK, in this video, I'm going to remind you of so many things that I already told you in projects in

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,100
previous security videos, also make sure you follow these things religiously.

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,370
It's just a reminder I told you these things.

4
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:22,240
You have to disable hood, Epic's keys and security again through a police organization.

5
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,660
You can force that route.

6
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:29,980
Logging is disable that also you can do, but primarily make sure Rutba access keys and secured keys

7
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,660
are disabled or deleted.

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:40,170
Again, I cannot keep this stressing more, but security groups should allow only limited IPD immediate

9
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,980
protocols and doesn't matter how many times I tell them there are people, not you specifically, but,

10
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:53,790
you know, in the project, the developers, the testers, the non ops guys mostly tend to enable rules,

11
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:55,060
allow everything.

12
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,280
So, again, you can force them by using IAM policies or organizations, ACP mostly through I am policy

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,519
that, you know, you don't have access to disable the access.

14
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,350
So they cannot, you know, edit the security rules.

15
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:09,540
That will be a vital thing.

16
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:17,670
Password, protect your login keys, keep us from where we create, put it into some password protected

17
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,460
folder or tool somewhere.

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:28,290
Whenever a person leaves an organization, it's an ideal practice to change your keys, you know, you

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:34,230
can go to the authorized keys, you can remove the existing public key, and you can generate new keepers

20
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,290
and store it annuities you to or you can launch a placement of EU instruments with new keys.

21
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:46,470
That's a standard practice of compliance, mostly only implemented in most of the organization.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:54,250
Rotate your credentials, the access key secret if you're using if if you don't need a place using A.W.

23
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:55,990
services, then the rules are fine.

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,100
No, it's better to avoid keys.

25
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,240
But if you have keys used by from someone's laptop, some data center somewhere, so make sure you rotate

26
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,190
those credentials.

27
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,630
You should have some compliance in an organization like that to disable this Olcay then, you know,

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,790
create a new key DBE credentials, what credentials that you are maintaining.

29
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:22,700
You can also use a secret manager service, eatables, secret managers service to store your credential

30
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:24,320
and rotate the credentials.

31
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:26,390
It comes to be another thing.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,140
But now take note on that.

33
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,830
It's expensive service.

34
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,050
Also, again, I know you.

35
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:37,970
It takes a lot of money for encrypting your variables, but it does so many amazing things.

36
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:44,270
Auditing credentials and ah, so you can use that eatables secret manager service, but do check the

37
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:46,580
charges before you use that service.

38
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,830
In Ayam, you have the access advisor service user to check.

39
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,960
The lease privileges, are you following that lease privileged to the users?

40
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,590
When the images are last changed.

41
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:05,070
If you go to I am user.

42
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:09,200
Axis adviser, you can see all this information.

43
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:18,460
And using Bastiaan Horse to enforce control, like only one point of entry into your VPC, we did this

44
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,280
in Terraformed Project Announceable Project and in the upcoming videos, I'm going to again talk about

45
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:30,610
Bastian Horse and how much more you can secure that and enforce control from that.

46
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:42,350
So this is really a secure design, you have an application VPC over there and you have public subnet,

47
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:45,890
private subnets, these and other WPK management VPC.

48
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:50,060
So we can put our Bastian host in a separate VPC together.

49
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,590
And we do work from management VPC to application VPC.

50
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:59,030
This is where you don't know your observer application server database server will be living off your

51
00:03:59,030 --> 00:03:59,480
project.

52
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:00,860
To manage those.

53
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,510
We can create a separate VPC.

54
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,040
We can put our Bastiano there.

55
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,500
You can put even your developes tools over there.

56
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,650
But Bastiaan Horse is going to be in a public subnet because you need to exit from the public network

57
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:16,820
to jump into your vehicles, onto your private subnet in the BBC.

58
00:04:17,260 --> 00:04:17,470
Right.

59
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:24,620
So accessing it from the accessing Bastian, Horst, from the Internet, you can see here one more thing.

60
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,150
You can have VPN connection.

61
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:30,350
So that goes privately encrypted connection.

62
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,230
And from there you can log in to your application VPC.

63
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,170
So this is really multiple layers.

64
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:42,410
To get into your infrastructure, if you are an authorized person, you should not have any problem,

65
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:49,370
but if you are unauthorized cyber criminals, someone then, you know, has to break so many levels

66
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:49,990
to get in.

67
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,810
So we are just becoming a tough target or tougher, tougher target.

68
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:58,370
And we are using all the amazing EWR security services to do that.

69
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:06,030
Now, when you're creating, as you do insurance, you you'll fetch an EMI from a marketplace, obviously.

70
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:14,600
So you have the option of open Oracle, S.O.S, Windows Server, so many options, but are they really

71
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,070
safe?

72
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:23,700
I mean, yeah, they applauded by Devinder and we can see want to officially Amies Centaurus, officially

73
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:27,290
Amemiya from RedHat and Amazon Linux itself.

74
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:34,320
But these images operating system, we have operating system that, of course, the operating system

75
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,580
has vulnerabilities and they keep growing and growing and growing.

76
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,730
So we need to find the vulnerabilities in the operating system and we are to fix it.

77
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:44,520
It's a lot of work, really.

78
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,900
Trust me, it's a lot of work.

79
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:49,810
If you ever done that scanning to find vulnerabilities.

80
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,370
You know, there's a huge list and it's also description how to fix those.

81
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,640
There's a lot of work.

82
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:56,040
So what can we do?

83
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,180
Well, you can use security hadan EMI from Eatables Marketplace.

84
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:09,250
You know, these are not free images for you provided from a center of Internet security or Eisel or

85
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,400
from Sance or from Nyst.

86
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:16,040
And there are a few other providers, but these are the famous ones.

87
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:23,110
So what these organizations will do, they will take an army of one, two or sentosa any operating system

88
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,550
like that, they will harden.

89
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,040
They'll find out all the vulnerabilities and they'll fix it.

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,040
And then you can keep updating them to make sure that you're using secure and hardened EMI.

91
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:38,770
So your operating system does not have a vulnerability or less vulnerabilities.

92
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,820
Big example of such.

93
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:42,250
We are saying it's encrypted connection.

94
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:42,520
Yes.

95
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,680
You're logging in with GIS.

96
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:50,110
Yes, these are serious, but the city itself has vulnerabilities which can be exploited by the cyber

97
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:50,640
criminals.

98
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:57,370
So these secure, hardened armies will remove those vulnerabilities to patch patriot or you can run

99
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,110
your own scanning and patch them.

100
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,420
And that is also fine.

101
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,780
So we'll see both ways.

102
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,730
We'll see the security in Miami.

103
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:06,880
We'll see scanning and patching, scanning mostly.

104
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:15,650
Well, here specifically, I'm talking about batching for vulnerabilities, but there are batching available

105
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:17,120
from the vendor itself.

106
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:22,190
Like from Ubuntu, from RedHat, from Windows, you know, really Ziggler Patches.

107
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:27,380
So make sure whenever you launch an instance, you do some bootstrapping and he can use the easy to

108
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,080
use areata.

109
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,660
And you can add on your app update, upgrade command, update windows, update all those commands.

110
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:39,690
So you for bootstrapping, you can use normal Basche or Bache or partial commands or you can use it.

111
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,000
Ansible pampered chef.

112
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,050
You need to regularly keep patching your operating system.

113
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,550
So if there is a unwanted abilities Apache's provided it gets applied.

114
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,950
All if you're using cloud formation, you can use cloud formations, see if it.

115
00:07:56,110 --> 00:08:00,880
Now, a new patches may even break the system, so you better yesterday, of course, you'll be tested

116
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:05,650
in some test environment and then you do full production environment, but one that really should be

117
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:06,880
patched immediately.

118
00:08:07,950 --> 00:08:13,290
So there is a database of vulnerabilities, if it is published that there is a vulnerability, it will

119
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:18,180
be known by everyone, you know, if you have not patched your exposed.

120
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:25,550
And one is like that, keep on coming and organizations.

121
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:28,860
And the vendors keep creating patches for that.

122
00:08:28,890 --> 00:08:30,780
So this is going to be a regular thing, OK?

123
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,240
It's not like a one time walk.

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,020
It's going to be a maintenance kind of work.

125
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:35,669
And there's so many batching.

126
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:40,470
I'm specifically talking about security, patching, security patches, vulnerability assessment and

127
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:41,190
then patching it.

128
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:42,850
So.

129
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:48,940
AWB does provide a vulnerability assessment service, AWB inspector.

130
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:57,410
This can scan vulnerability in your network and in your operating system to scan it for your network.

131
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,250
There is no special settings you need to do.

132
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:02,600
Just go to inspect a service and scan your network.

133
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:03,410
That's fine.

134
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:09,520
But for scanning operating system, you need to install an agent based on your operating system.

135
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:10,160
It's a Linux.

136
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,190
You install Linux agent, Windows, Windows, Windows agent.

137
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:20,000
So you install an inspector agent and then you can use Eatables Inspector service to scan your network

138
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,380
and also the operating system.

139
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:26,780
It will generate a very detailed report of the vulnerability in your operating systems.

140
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:36,050
Or you can just use your top 10 vulnerability assessment tools like Comodo Open was necessary.

141
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,930
There are so many when there would be assessment tools, you can use them, generate report.

142
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,480
But keep in mind, you are generating the report badged so you can fix those vulnerabilities, not just

143
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,890
about scanning, it's also about patching after that.

144
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:54,430
So next, we'll be seeing a police inspector service.

145
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,330
So join me on Eatables console.

146
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,630
I'm opening the inspectors service.

147
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:12,300
OK, so it says, I have to install in Eatables agent on my instant's run assessment and then I can

148
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:12,960
review it.

149
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:19,030
If you're going to scan the operating system with Inspector, then you definitely need to install the

150
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,360
agent.

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:22,660
But if you just want to scan the network, you don't need to install any agent.

152
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,220
So we'll do both.

153
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,440
So I'm going to go to the easy to service.

154
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,450
I already have insurance agents over here.

155
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:30,080
Running.

156
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:39,200
And its name is Cops, and there's a log in Geekcorps Keisel, let me log in to the D.C. Dunstan's first.

157
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,080
It's an Ubuntu machine.

158
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:55,470
I guess I'll be the road user I have to install inspector agent.

159
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,630
From the documentation installing Amazon inspector agent.

160
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,300
So if it's Amazo Linux, it's really simple to install inspector agent, you can install Inspector Adrian

161
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:08,560
through systems manager.

162
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,170
Will install it directly logged into the U.S. Dunstone so I'm going to download this Shell script so

163
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,410
you can use Gathercole to download the script, install Scorpions Bastard.

164
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:29,960
And they should be in Shell script install, I'm just going to see Bash install.

165
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:40,270
OK, it's installed, let's see, it's status, it will create an Inuit script you see in it, don't

166
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:47,410
be eatables agent see status and it says it's active and running.

167
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:52,490
It's not registered to anything, so you can see these errors, but once we register it.

168
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,790
And we done the scanning, you should not see this error, so that's running as of now.

169
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,300
Also, we need to do one more thing before we scan.

170
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,880
We have to give a special tag, some tag.

171
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,210
So I just have the name tag for inspector to.

172
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:15,510
Scattergories, you tombstone's, we have to give the tag details which Dagg instance you want to scan.

173
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,510
So I want to see project.

174
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,820
If the profile.

175
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,820
If.

176
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,470
Now let's go to inspector service.

177
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,800
And we can see get started.

178
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:40,210
So network assessment and host assessment for network, you do need agent for host assessment.

179
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,340
You see, inspector agent is required.

180
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,890
And there are also charges mentioned over here, for example, an instance assessment weekly, sixty

181
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,930
one dollars per month, that's weekly.

182
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,650
So you can automate this process.

183
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,550
It runs weekly.

184
00:12:57,290 --> 00:13:03,470
And generate reports for you, OK, this advance set up over here, you can just click on Ron Weekly

185
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:06,750
and it will automatically skirted around it weekly or you can run it once.

186
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:10,710
This will just scan everything in your current network, all these.

187
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,770
But let's be specific.

188
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,060
It was set up.

189
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:23,620
So assessment target we are going to create now for Target that we want to scan, so I will see the

190
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:31,830
profile in from something like that include all these other instances in this account and region.

191
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:39,850
No, I want to be specific so I can select the tag project, the profile so every in any instance that

192
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:40,870
has this tag.

193
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:47,120
And it has the agent installed and running, it will do the scanning install agent, do you want to

194
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,940
install agent will install, his agent is already installed, so we don't need to install it again and

195
00:13:52,940 --> 00:14:00,650
check that if you wish to install it like this, then you have to make sure you create an IM role with

196
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:07,940
a system agent privilege so it will login to your insurance access, for instance, and install the

197
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,920
agent for you don't need to do it manually.

198
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,330
That also can be done.

199
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,070
So next.

200
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:23,070
Now we go to the target, we are going to see what we need to scan, so I'll just cancel all this forced.

201
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,800
I'll give some names can.

202
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:29,930
All.

203
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,860
Well, notably some, namely Canada like that.

204
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:42,330
So you have four options, security, best practices, it will scan, I want to do that.

205
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:42,750
Yes.

206
00:14:43,170 --> 00:14:45,030
Common vulnerabilities and exposure.

207
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,760
Yes, I want that network reliability.

208
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,260
Yes, I want to scan that.

209
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,920
Six benchmarks.

210
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,200
Yes.

211
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:52,670
So these are very popular things.

212
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,090
OK, you can read about this, the lots and lots of checks that is done.

213
00:14:58,390 --> 00:14:59,740
Against our operating system.

214
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:07,240
Duration one hour is recommended, it will take a very long time to generate all those reports, too

215
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,360
much of scanning happens.

216
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:14,320
You can set up a recurrence every seven days or aspell your preference.

217
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,850
I'm just going to do it for one side and check that.

218
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:18,410
Go next.

219
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,950
We will have everything is good and to create.

220
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,380
I guess it's his assessment started.

221
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:37,240
You can see I know I can see here collecting data, scan all one liberty, that's our template assessment

222
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,720
target.

223
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:38,620
Let's go to assessment.

224
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,470
So we profile intra.

225
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,320
Review target, so that's our target audience is unhealthy, it's not yet registered.

226
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:57,420
OK, what do you see in a moment at issuing Healthy Again Refresher, this releases that the agent is

227
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,030
running and it's able to talk to the inspector service.

228
00:16:00,450 --> 00:16:05,670
If you keep seeing this unhealthy, then you better check your insurance agents health.

229
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:09,870
OK, ours is running and it's showing.

230
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:17,990
Healthy, these problems occur when you installing agent from system, so probably the rule you have

231
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:19,790
not given correct to these you Dunstan's.

232
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:26,200
And because of some reason, your system is not able to access your students to install the agent,

233
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,440
so it will keep showing you unhealthy, so you have to fix that forced.

234
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,020
OK, so that's healthy and that's our template.

235
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:39,030
She created we can change the rules whenever we want.

236
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:46,100
And assessment is going on and it's going to take very, very long time, but I do have a sample data.

237
00:16:47,630 --> 00:16:49,400
Which is in Oregon region.

238
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:56,090
I did this yesterday, for Aniceto instance, and you can see your status.

239
00:16:57,270 --> 00:17:03,900
Inspector received 857 deliberately message in total from one agent, so the scanning is executed by

240
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,220
the agent and then returns the data and you can see that in the findings section.

241
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:13,599
So you can filter it in a high priority, low priority, you know.

242
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:18,640
And you will go crazy if you've seen this first time vulnerability.

243
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,190
Now you'll go crazy looking at these many warnings, these many alerts.

244
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:28,329
It's crazy for a reason, I'm telling you, because you have to fix all this.

245
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,120
Imagine that, OK?

246
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,300
Of course, there will be details of how to fix their description, recommendation, what you have to

247
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:36,540
do.

248
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,040
Some are very simple.

249
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:38,880
Some takes time.

250
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,350
But imagine the amount of time that goes in fixing this with these many vulnerabilities.

251
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,620
OK, we have information on vulnerability.

252
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,430
Which is just one or it's going on a low.

253
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:00,870
So you target on high vulnerability first, right, and then medium and then low like that, it can

254
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,110
go.

255
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:08,120
If you want, you can download all this report and Taraborrelli, you can be selective and you can click

256
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,230
on this button over here, so you download export all columns or export visible columns.

257
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,650
I want to see all columns.

258
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,460
So since CSU format.

259
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:21,240
You can see those.

260
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,590
But they're not all, actually.

261
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:30,770
So this is for you know, you're looking for specific vulnerability, you find it and you want to export

262
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:36,770
it, but if you want to download this entire report, go to dashboard and you should see here all the

263
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:41,960
scanning results and you can click on that which you find and you can download the report.

264
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:49,090
So in PDF for the information which you wish to, you want to get a finding reports on your full report

265
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,460
and the full report and to generate a report.

266
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,510
The pop up is blog.

267
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:57,300
I will see Ladak.

268
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,220
Once again.

269
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,340
Generator power.

270
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:10,810
And that opens in a different browser.

271
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,450
Yes, of course, you can download it then.

272
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:14,620
Sievert.

273
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,730
You know, we downloaded let's open it.

274
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,690
On open file.

275
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:29,810
OK, be it was just opening it in the browser itself, I opened it from the add up reader, so you see

276
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:33,230
it's 212 pages of report.

277
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:34,770
OK.

278
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:41,430
Of course, it's everything, not just the finding, but, you know, take your time, take your time,

279
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,020
read these reports.

280
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:48,430
Not in the end, but, you know, go through them, at least the initial stages, you go through them,

281
00:19:48,850 --> 00:19:54,820
see few of them randomly pick up anything and see if you can fix those things by the recommendation

282
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:57,020
that they're giving a description recommendation.

283
00:19:57,050 --> 00:20:01,880
So I think I did this file and put this parameter in.

284
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:04,260
Once you do that, of course, you're to bounce the service.

285
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,330
So there are 100 businesses.

286
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,240
Yes.

287
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,130
So you have to first fix that.

288
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:17,720
I know if you think that's too much of a joke, man, so then you can invest a little more money and

289
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,140
you can go to D.C. to service.

290
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:24,220
And instead of.

291
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,750
Now fetching up an EU, Azarian, EMI, from the vendor directly, you can source from the tablas marketplace.

292
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:37,850
You can go for security product group or, you know, you can just search your favorite.

293
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:46,490
Provider like, for example, the center of Internet Security, a search for that, so Red Hat Enterprise

294
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:52,040
Linux, CISO want to now I'm not saying there would be no clarity on this, but there'll be very less,

295
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,540
which can be fixed very quickly.

296
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,410
And you get updates also and there are charges they are not free.

297
00:20:57,430 --> 00:21:01,070
So zero point zero two dollars per hour, you can of course, try them.

298
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,150
It's not a big charge.

299
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:08,480
But if you want to go for nearly 130 dollars a year, really not a big thing for organization, even

300
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,230
if it's a startup.

301
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,480
So to begin with, you can again really try with.

302
00:21:15,610 --> 00:21:22,750
The had am I run the assessment and you can find out the report and you can compare it with Ovando image

303
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:23,410
from Devinder.

304
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:29,370
And you can find a lot of differences, but nevertheless, this is going to be a continuous process.

305
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:33,330
You have to keep scanning things to keep fixing things so you can automate.

306
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:40,230
This process is also being a divorce, not fixing, but definitely running patches, running, scanning

307
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:41,970
regularly through Inspecteur.

308
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:45,550
Or if you using some third party tool, then you can automate that as well.

309
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:51,810
There could be a separate security team mostly, which can do and work on fixing.

310
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:55,310
All you did, Ozick environment, and you need to do that.

311
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,400
All right, so in this section, we talked about the police inspector service specifically, we talked

312
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:06,470
about what we need best practices also that you have to follow, keeping, patching and updating regularly,

313
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,180
securing your keys, your passwords and other things.

314
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:18,110
And the next video, we will be talking specifically on network security, VPC, security group Mackle,

315
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,190
those kind of things.

316
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:22,010
So that's all in the studio with you in the next one.
