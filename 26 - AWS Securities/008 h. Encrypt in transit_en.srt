1
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:07,530
In this video, we'll be talking about encryption in-transit, the data that flows from point A to point

2
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:07,770
B.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:12,970
As I said earlier, appeals mechanism can be used to encrypt the data in transit.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,170
What we're really talking about over here is a user accessing your website through a load balancer,

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,180
you are giving access with a deep protocol which is unencrypted.

6
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:31,030
So if you use it as sending any data like user names, passwords, contact details, card details,

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,430
you will go on and cryptid.

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,380
Anybody can spoof, you know, in the middle and tap in the middle and get their data and clear text.

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,960
So it has the connection should be encrypted in this case.

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,650
So we can use DBS connection on your load balancer.

11
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:47,840
You can dominate the encryption at the load balancer.

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:51,070
We have done that already so many times in our projects.

13
00:00:51,070 --> 00:00:56,800
We had a certificate provided by Amazon certificate manager.

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,760
We use that to encrypt our data in-transit just coming to our load balancer.

15
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:06,500
Then were there other kinds of loot as well, like S3 Buckett, the data that goes?

16
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:13,010
And if you want to force encryption like your data can be accessed from the supercut unencrypted also,

17
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:19,800
but you can force that with policy, with a three bucket policy that hate my data can be only access

18
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,900
with a secure connection to GPS and not with normal unencrypted data.

19
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:33,090
You can use for load balancing the certificate from ACM, which you already created in political science

20
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:34,790
video, and we have already done that.

21
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,810
So I'm just going to go through it.

22
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:40,040
Just do once again show you again explain the concept.

23
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,900
But a new thing that you're going to see is the bucket policy, which we're going to enforce for S3

24
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,980
encrypted connection.

25
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:55,450
The other connections to talk about is having a VPN access from your data center, from your environment

26
00:01:55,450 --> 00:02:02,710
to eatables accounts, accessing your Dunston's through research or IDP or extra points or Dinham would

27
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:08,169
be whatever data you're accessing from your resources, it should be accessed through the secure connection.

28
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,570
So data would be Bengal's encrypted.

29
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,750
So services like, you know, as 3G access or the Internet are the data we can access.

30
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:19,680
If you make it public, you can encrypt that also in transit.

31
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:27,730
And again, this is about transit data not addressed in transit download Dinamo DB2 access to the end

32
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:29,800
points or Yamal data.

33
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,860
In these cases, you really don't need to do much.

34
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,170
You just need to enforce other kinds of data.

35
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:39,850
Of course, there are so many sources that goes with the study.

36
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:46,960
Connection could come a repository, for example, become overcommitting the code we can use to WRAL.

37
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,300
We can use such Yooralla.

38
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:53,920
In any case, both go send the data encrypted only connection.

39
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,360
The data again goes through encrypted Secich goes encrypted DB server traffic you can enforce and it

40
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,240
goes encrypted.

41
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:07,280
So you see most of the connection of protocol that we are using since the data encrypted using SSL Attila's.

42
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:13,990
But some places you have to really enforce like a load balancer, use only trippiest noise to traffic

43
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,860
or street use only is to be based on a secure connection.

44
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,040
Encrypted connection is nothing to do with the already been tested.

45
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,450
It's already encrypted connection.

46
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:26,830
So will take example of the load balancer and will take example of the EU budget.

47
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,270
So let's dive in.

48
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:36,760
OK, so I have an easy to it's running a service Jenkins service on board AT&T.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,350
Which is unencrypted connection.

50
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:47,080
It's using the protocol, it should be so we can just access this oral.

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,210
Aditi.

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:58,330
OK, so that connection is not security, but clearly your browser will clearly tell you that it's not

53
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:59,210
a secure connection.

54
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,380
Now you say it's just jenkins', but think about it.

55
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:05,380
You're entering username and password here that's going on encrypted.

56
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,740
You're storing credentials in Jenkins, the copy paste work you're doing that's going over the connection.

57
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:18,720
There's so many things that we put in jenkins' like source code of so many, so many things, really.

58
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:21,279
Everything is going on encrypted.

59
00:04:21,790 --> 00:04:29,020
So from point A to point B, let's assume Pierpoint E Jenkins is point B if there is some man in middle

60
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,430
reading your communication man in middle attack.

61
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,260
All right.

62
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:39,640
So if they're capturing your network traffic, they can see the data and clear text.

63
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,190
So there are two ways to do this.

64
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:46,990
One, in the server itself, you can store the certificate and you can enable the deepest connection,

65
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:53,980
but then that will put law on the system because then then the system will be doing encryption and decryption.

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:56,500
For Jenkins, it's at least it's fine.

67
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,870
But if it's on a website for the public, you know, to so many users coming in, the encryption decryption

68
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:09,160
is done by the website or the application server, it will impact on the law so we can take a load balancer,

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:14,140
put it in front of it, will encrypt the connection from us to the load balancer, from load balancer

70
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:16,240
to Jenkins or to any Web server.

71
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:19,930
The data can be unencrypted if as long as it's in a private network.

72
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,450
So if I put my jenckes in a private subnet load, balancing in a public subnet, which will see in the

73
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,870
VBC section after this and are dominated by a previous connection on load balancer, I'm totally safe.

74
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:34,810
So let's go to easy to let's create a load balancer.

75
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,440
One thing let me remind you, we're here, I have to switch to North Virginia region because I have.

76
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:50,200
My certificate in is included in North Virginia region, and I hope you would have also done the same

77
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,690
thing from the previous video.

78
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:54,610
So you're going to use a certificate.

79
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:04,180
That certificate of victory in the political sights, so the certificate is in North Virginia region,

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:10,630
so make sure your workload in this instance is in Norfolk, Virginia, and we have to carry the load

81
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:12,070
balancer also in that region.

82
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:18,010
So only in my North Virginia, I have the jenkins' server again, similar thing.

83
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:20,560
And I'm going to create a load balancer.

84
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:28,120
So I say create load balancer and go with classic for now.

85
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:38,750
And I am going to make this to be a secure connection and let me give a name and say Jenkins hyphen

86
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,470
Elby.

87
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:46,520
Insta sport, which will be jenkins', is running so soon.

88
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:52,550
So it's going to receive the request, dominate your previous connection at load balancer and from load

89
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:57,050
balancer, it will go to the instance on duty assigned security groups.

90
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,730
I'm going to create a new security group here.

91
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:02,800
I can see Jenkins hyphen Elby.

92
00:07:05,210 --> 00:07:10,700
And this what if this is really for public, then you can give it anywhere, but if it's not, then

93
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,660
it might be.

94
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,210
Right to call dibs, go next.

95
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:21,370
All right, now here you will get an option to upload your certificate or you can choose a certificate

96
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:23,020
from Ekom, which you already have.

97
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:28,710
It's the same thing for the application load balancer, also configured health check.

98
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:35,570
Katie noindex A.M. Just four should be fine health check.

99
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,110
I would give just two for now so it can come off very quickly.

100
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,860
At instance, I will add my drinking, for instance.

101
00:07:41,870 --> 00:07:45,410
Now, if this instance is in a private subnet, this is much more better.

102
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,720
Can do some tag, let's say create.

103
00:07:53,960 --> 00:08:00,350
So load balancer is created, but it will not be able to perform the health check because my Ecija instance

104
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:05,930
security group will not allow to be accessed from anywhere other than my IP.

105
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,870
So I'm going to need the security group of my student students.

106
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,010
I will say I did rule.

107
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:14,130
And I will say AT&T is allowed from.

108
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,540
Portree, Haiti.

109
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:27,120
From the load balancer security group, so there's my Jenkins Elby security group, you want to be just

110
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,890
safe, just delete this rule.

111
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:33,250
And let's see, see, Ron.

112
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:41,830
So A.J. Jenkins instant security group allows connection from the Lord Balancer Security Group on board

113
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,590
so that we, the health check, will be able to perform and the traffic can be altered, altered or

114
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,040
allowed.

115
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,350
Let's go to the load balancer.

116
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:56,620
And it's going to take some time to make it healthy, declared healthy is currently out of service,

117
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:57,850
still in progress.

118
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:02,680
While it was out of service for a long time, the health check were failing.

119
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:06,280
Then I had to make a little change in the health check.

120
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,820
I said Slash Log-in and Cevdet.

121
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:13,670
And then it became healthy.

122
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:19,600
So if you're also using Jenkins's health check and then to be fined.

123
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,440
And to test that, I also had to enable the security group rule of the Jenkins' I said aloud from my

124
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,180
IP, but if I do that, I will be accessing it directly on duty from my IP.

125
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,090
That would be not secure connection.

126
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,650
So remove that rule.

127
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,910
Allow only access from the load balancer.

128
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:41,090
Save.

129
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,580
OK, now let's use the load balancer and point.

130
00:09:54,060 --> 00:10:00,060
So each night, GDP is colon slash slash.

131
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:10,030
So that it alerts you that it is not a known certificate because a certificate is for gruffy dot in

132
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,460
domain, not for Amazon, Netflix, dot com, that's the problem.

133
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,840
But if you at the entry in the DNS.

134
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:23,390
Like, I'm using GoDaddy, so if I had the entry of this early, if I access it through that you all,

135
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,690
then I will not see this problem.

136
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:29,310
And let me do that, I'll go to GoDaddy account.

137
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:34,020
But you don't need to do that, you know, you can skip that part.

138
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:38,460
Nevertheless, it's going to go it's going to be an encrypted connection, but it's just that the browser

139
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,410
does not recognize cannot match your certificate with this end point.

140
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:45,710
So for that reason, you don't get that error message.

141
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:54,090
We can add a in record and we will see jenkins' or whatever hostname you want to prefer and give your

142
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,660
end point.

143
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,010
Of your load balancer Sievert.

144
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:11,270
And then we can access it like this jenkins', dot, gruffy dot in, and of course I would Jenkins'

145
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,080
and I have to say yes, colon slash, slash.

146
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,730
So that message you will get, because we just updated the entry and it's going to take time to publish

147
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:26,850
and come to our nearest DNS server or Internet service provider.

148
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,450
So after waiting for almost 15, 20 minutes, I am able to resolve that.

149
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:39,900
Minder's, those border DNS cache is audiences a little slower to fetch that right?

150
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:46,720
But maybe if you're in U.S. region, European region, and it will be resolved very quickly.

151
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,490
So, as I said, you can do this or you can skip this part, but I just wanted to show you the certificate

152
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,990
of connection is secure.

153
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:57,540
It's a as a certificate is valid.

154
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:03,090
You see that certificate valid and you can see the certificate it's issued for gruffy dot in.

155
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:12,090
By any star dot, gruffy dot in so any horse we can cure their cancer, gruffy dot and it works fine,

156
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:14,310
it is issued by Amazon right now.

157
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:16,650
It can actually see, can I give username and password?

158
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,220
I login, I store any information.

159
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,330
The data is going to go encrypted encryption in-transit.

160
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:30,290
I know we did this exercise previously also in our projects for the observers.

161
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,540
But now we focus, we're focusing more on encryption here, on security.

162
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:37,730
So you need to understand these points.

163
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,700
Let's see one more encryption in-transit, which is for S3.

164
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,700
Now, also, you can just delete the load balancer if your work is done, you can delete your instance,

165
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,850
I will go now to the free service.

166
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,780
I guess I'll pick up some random bucket, I have some data in the buckets, that one.

167
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,570
You can create a bucket, upload some data, so.

168
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,620
Let's see classis application, the Acropolis file.

169
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,060
This is a file on this.

170
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:19,230
Well, there's no next extension, so to be a problem, let's.

171
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:24,840
Find our science direct budget that we created previously.

172
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,550
And let me tell you this.

173
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:34,360
Object and we applaud this a bit.

174
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:42,960
If you have encryption enabled and if you want to disable it for this exercise, you can do that.

175
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,350
But if you're accessing with the admin user route user or the user who has the ownership of the key,

176
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:52,490
then this will work fine.

177
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,120
No problem.

178
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:00,780
So I applaud and contact text again.

179
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,380
So any bucket in utero is fine for now.

180
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,960
And just to follow the excise, just make sure it's a tax data.

181
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:14,580
The object.

182
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,040
And I click on Open.

183
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:28,220
All right, so you see beautiful, isn't it, strip's connection, but if we want and switch to a strategy

184
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:28,730
B.

185
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,080
That is also fine, you see, I'm seeing all this data unencrypted.

186
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:40,610
So no one is forcing me to sit in encrypted right now, this, if there is a man in middle can see this

187
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:45,890
data so we can only apply force on the EU budget through policies.

188
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,690
In your permission.

189
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,060
Budget policy added.

190
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:58,470
And I'm going to put a policy over here that will force for encryption, I assure you, that policy.

191
00:14:59,490 --> 00:15:03,610
So your documentation is three Buckett SSL request only occasionally SSL.

192
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,820
So this is a policy.

193
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,380
I'm just going to copy that.

194
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,900
Here, there's a copy, but button copy that.

195
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:19,970
I go to my three bucket bastard and I just change the Iren, so Coppelia, it's right there off your

196
00:15:19,970 --> 00:15:21,620
bucket, so I just replace it.

197
00:15:21,630 --> 00:15:23,840
And this took place there.

198
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,030
Make sure that there is, you know, that and star there and also here.

199
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,310
OK, let's see what it is really releasing.

200
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:42,340
There's also an account number, Auriel, allow principal who OK, so I'm going to remove that and say

201
00:15:42,370 --> 00:15:43,950
double courts staff.

202
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:55,860
So as three get for anyone, anyone is allowed to read it, but denies this basically makes the market

203
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:05,700
public OK, this ruling makes it public and here deny to everyone every action on this bucket if this

204
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:10,160
is a condition, OK, if it helps secure transport, false.

205
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,320
This is this is for us.

206
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,770
This is for everyone, OK?

207
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,310
It's a public access over here.

208
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,530
But anyways, it's going to be encrypted.

209
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,590
You should be having principle there like an accountant or your username user to make sure it's for

210
00:16:25,590 --> 00:16:26,580
a specific person.

211
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,300
OK, but just for exercise, I will just show you changes.

212
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,960
And let's go to the object.

213
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,600
And let's click on that.

214
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,180
Open.

215
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:50,810
OK, if I change that from a strips to actually be it, enter.

216
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:59,240
If you're not allowed that, you see that now I can be really specific and give it to a user or any

217
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:01,850
tablas account, because this is public display.

218
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,110
Anybody can see it.

219
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:06,670
But the point here is the encryption in-transit.

220
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,380
Let's give the public until.

221
00:17:10,490 --> 00:17:14,619
The trips, but not with a strip.

222
00:17:17,990 --> 00:17:19,490
So here I am forcing.

223
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:25,560
In a different mechanism, I'm forcing here with policy that should be only encrypted, it's trippiest

224
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:28,480
connection for load balancer, how can be forceful?

225
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:35,140
Don't give direct access to to Dunstan's a business connection allowed only for a load balancer and

226
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,720
Noisebridge connection so you can force in that be.

227
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,830
OK, if you are done with the exercise, you can just terminate the load balancers and delete your instances.

228
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,500
So coming back to this policy, right, it should be a specific you know, you don't make it public

229
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:54,210
if you don't need to make it public.

230
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:00,870
And again, you can use eatables organization and force people to not make the buckets public, even

231
00:18:00,870 --> 00:18:01,530
accidentally.

232
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:08,490
So that's all in this video, we have seen encryption in-transit for a lot of observers and forestry

233
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:15,170
bucket Secich RTP, we really need to make any changes, but there are so few things we need to really

234
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,810
take care of that we'll be seeing that in next videos.

235
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,560
That is all for now.
