1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,330
So can you talk about, erm, user group and rules?

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,800
And this is, I think, the primary thing that you should really take care of, if this is compromise,

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:14,510
you know, doesn't matter how much security you implemented, everything goes out of the window.

4
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:18,680
OK, so no shared user identity.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:25,820
Every individual who is using your eatables account should have their own user, their own erm user.

6
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:27,410
And then you can control on that.

7
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:29,890
You can keep track of who is doing what and when.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:38,380
OK, so individual user access only no sharing of credential and control them by using erm policies.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:44,710
So if there is a developer, the developer should have only access to services that he or she needs,

10
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:50,020
like S3 or S.A.S. or MQ or whatever, and you can control all those things.

11
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,020
You're going to see that in policies on hands, on lab.

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:56,440
And you should group things together.

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:03,490
There could be many, many users having different different policies or similar policies or similar

14
00:01:03,490 --> 00:01:09,280
policy different from user like developers, group or testers, group or developers groups or admins

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,540
group.

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:14,680
You can manage all all these things better by creating a group and giving permission at the group level,

17
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,560
which makes it easier to manage also.

18
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:26,710
In prerequisites video I have explained about username and password with multifactor authentication,

19
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,700
if it's a password based login to the console, there should be definitely multifactor authentication.

20
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,840
Be very careful with access keys.

21
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:41,020
You know, some organization have so much tight control that they will not allow users to create access

22
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:41,440
keys.

23
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:49,120
And we'll see how we can implement that law organization, you can have multifactor authentication on

24
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:56,140
APCLS as well, since access keys are so dangerous, it's always recommended to use embroils, which

25
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,320
will generate temporary credentials or the credentials that really rotates automatically.

26
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:06,370
So if you're purely on your WCA, using Kleinsorge uneatable servers also need a blast and you can use

27
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,180
IAM rules.

28
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:09,070
Do not use access keys.

29
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,770
This access keys are very dangerous rules uses the keys internally.

30
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:16,330
They get rotated automatically.

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:18,040
There is no chance of exposing it.

32
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,430
So that's the safest method if you're already on W.S..

33
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,160
So let's get into A.I.M. so we can see some action with policies.

34
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:30,440
So let's go to I am service.

35
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:36,770
So currently, I don't have any users in my account, no groups.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,450
There are so many rules.

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,330
Customer managed policy, 65 customer managed policies now, by the way, is the same account that I

38
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:48,770
have used throughout the course in different different projects.

39
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,230
So as I mentioned the previous night's video, you have to enable multifactor authentication and water

40
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:56,130
security alerts.

41
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,580
You see over here, you have to fix it.

42
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:01,290
So it sees the root user for this account does not have a MFAT enabled.

43
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:08,730
So we should enable multifactor authentication for road user are much better when we see the next service

44
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:13,920
organization will disable the login itself, will not let anyone use the route user.

45
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,020
So no chance of making that mistake itself.

46
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:22,930
So I'm not doing that, I mean, those security things waterboarded in political video, if you're not

47
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,870
seeing it followed once again, do all the prerequisites for the I am for your loss account and then

48
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:30,010
you can continue from here.

49
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,410
And I will do one thing on this alias and give a new account name.

50
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,790
I will call it a secure.

51
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,010
The profile.

52
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,190
Alias or whatever, you feel like this has to be unique, OK?

53
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:54,730
So I'm jumping directly into policies now and policies we can attach it to user to group and to rules,

54
00:03:54,770 --> 00:04:01,470
these policies gives the authorization for a user or a group or a role to do X, Y, Z things.

55
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:04,630
So you have two kinds of policies over here.

56
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:06,820
The one where you see that symbol.

57
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:12,770
These are eatables managed policies created by W.S. and managed by W.S..

58
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:19,029
You can directly selected and attach it, but they are more open or more closed, like a complete read-only

59
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:21,070
access or full access, something like that.

60
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,770
But when you want to be very specific, like if you remember, we did this in continuous integration

61
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:35,780
project on the of side where you used code commit, we specifically created our own policy.

62
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:39,270
We said this user can only access this repository.

63
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,370
These are called customer managed policies.

64
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:46,500
If you click on filter policies, you can see customer managed policies.

65
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:48,030
If you click on that.

66
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:56,510
These are the policies that I have created in my account, and they don't have that symbol of this scroll

67
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,610
down there, I see VPP proof code.

68
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,130
This is a policy.

69
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:07,260
Now, the policies are inducing format, but you really don't need to write it in, Jason, you can

70
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,150
create it will take some example.

71
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:15,060
We already did that, like we created this policy in the project in Continuous Integration Project on

72
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,840
EWR, which created this policy, which I use, which has.

73
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,960
The statement effect allow so this policy is about allowing this action is about allowing these are

74
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,830
the actions.

75
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,400
I could commit a service list repository now update approval.

76
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,190
These are the list of actions which are allowed.

77
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:47,000
On all the resources and then you have one more over here, which is allow cold comfort and you have

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:51,920
the irony of the repository, the repositories of being very specific.

79
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,710
Only actions are only for this repository, not all the repositories.

80
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:07,130
On this repository and then here it's similar, but there is a fourth star that meets on this repository

81
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:15,290
and also contained in the repository, and so policies will be like this effect, allow or deny action.

82
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:18,560
What actions can be taken and resource on what?

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,220
For what?

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,920
And this policy will be Atash can be attached to a user, can be attached to a group or can be attached

85
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:31,580
to a role, and we'll take an example of creating our own policy and we'll create a policy that can

86
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:35,900
start and stop one particular instance, that's all.

87
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:41,030
And we will assign it to a user and we'll see whether that user is able to do anything else apart from

88
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:44,780
that also will put some extra read-only access to that user.

89
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,920
So let's first launch Aniceto instance.

90
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,270
So I have an easy to answer here.

91
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,570
It's a jenkins' incidents and there's the instance ID.

92
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:01,790
It's in running state, so maybe there is a developer who is using this Jenkins' instance and this developer,

93
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:06,680
I want to give only this much access that he can start and stop this easy to insurgents and don't cannot

94
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,150
do anything.

95
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,610
So I don't want to you to us to be always up and running, but I don't want every damn developer asking

96
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:13,940
me that.

97
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:14,970
Can you start the instant?

98
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,800
How can you stop this?

99
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:21,500
Just I want to give this to a developer that you log to console and you can start and stop instantly,

100
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,670
but only this one.

101
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,510
OK, so let's do that.

102
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,960
So we need to first create a policy.

103
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:33,500
So let's click on Create Policy so you can be like really hardcore and create all the Jason yourself.

104
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:39,020
And this documentation, I'll run you through the documentation, but let's create it through the editor,

105
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:43,080
so choose a service, I will choose the service to.

106
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,050
If you do service action, what action do you want?

107
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:53,870
So by default, what an action you select, it's going to be for the allow action.

108
00:07:53,870 --> 00:08:00,260
But if you want to have dinner, you can say switch to deny permission or you can go back to deny or

109
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:00,530
allow.

110
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:01,820
Remember one thing.

111
00:08:01,820 --> 00:08:03,470
Deny, supersedes, allow.

112
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:10,580
So if you have given deny noisey to access and then you have given allowing you to access so deny will

113
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:11,270
supersede.

114
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,550
Keep that in mind.

115
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:17,790
If you have conflicting permission, Dinni will supersede.

116
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:24,020
So there's a list read the difference between a list on your list.

117
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:28,370
As you know, you can just list those things reads, you know, you can do some grid operations on that

118
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:34,039
tagging and write book, which is making changes, you know, you can delete also.

119
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:39,640
So you can click on that and you can see all the actions which are you prefer.

120
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,490
You can select that.

121
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:43,590
You can just search it from here itself.

122
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,380
So I would like to start.

123
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,870
And stopping since they started shooting so carelessly like that and so full stop.

124
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,330
Stop instance.

125
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:59,610
OK, so two actions are selected for you to start and stop.

126
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:06,230
Resources on what now here, it's time to be specific only for that particular issue, for instance.

127
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,740
So I'm going to see Ariadna.

128
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,470
Now, I can give the region name first.

129
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,970
All star means all the regions, so I'll be specific only for that particular region, so which is my

130
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,630
instances in the US West to region.

131
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,520
Account only and the instant.

132
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:30,310
So let's go to the instance that's, for instance, I'd put it out there.

133
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:37,790
And let's see, you know, you can just say any which would be for all these incidents that also I can

134
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:40,040
do, I just add.

135
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,970
Wait a second.

136
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:43,870
This is Denyer.

137
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,170
I made a mistake, so let's remove it once.

138
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:51,620
Cancel, whoops.

139
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,870
OK, let's created once again create policy, choose a service.

140
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,050
You see two.

141
00:10:01,050 --> 00:10:04,050
Action, just start and stop.

142
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:05,570
Start.

143
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:07,800
Job.

144
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:13,320
Specifically, source, Aaron.

145
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,000
The region and the U.S. do instant add.

146
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,900
He's also request condition, you can put conditions also on that you can see probably if it's only

147
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,910
from this particular app, can you repeat your multifactor authentication is required or you can give

148
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:42,320
your own condition if something equals to something like the instance has or the user has this particular

149
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,080
tag, OK?

150
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:45,350
Like, for example, if you select your.

151
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:53,130
Like, for example, a resource tag, the tag resource tag means a tag on our resources, specifically

152
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:56,790
you to instance tag like you can give the tag.

153
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:04,590
And we can see if it's equal to a particular value, if this matches, then only it will allow that

154
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:06,590
action so you can give conditions like that again.

155
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,030
Think of many conditions based on your requirement.

156
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,260
We are not doing this because we are going to directly attach it to the user.

157
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,990
So we don't need this condition for now.

158
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,070
Let's review policy.

159
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:25,210
Let's give a name to this policy will start stop Jenkins'.

160
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,140
OK, create policy.

161
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:37,920
So this is a customer managed policy and start stop to think it's OK, that's a policy.

162
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:41,820
No, let's create a user and user, let's name it as.

163
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,250
Developer.

164
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:52,300
And we'll just give management console access and see custom password.

165
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,970
And give some password and remove request password reset.

166
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,560
Foster does not match.

167
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,590
Oh, yeah, so I have policies now.

168
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:11,730
It does not match my previous password.

169
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:16,270
OK, now here I am going to give permission.

170
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:25,650
Through my door policy to my policy that I created start and stop, OK, so this user will only have

171
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:28,500
this policy and create producer.

172
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:36,760
All right, and you are also I'm going to copy that you are an open a different browser.

173
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,170
I give the user name, which is a wrong spelling when I created it, says.

174
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:47,960
Signing.

175
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,180
Now we know this user, why is it asking to reset the password?

176
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:58,120
I thought to ensure that I can use let's reset the password, which is a good thing.

177
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:13,210
OK, we're in.

178
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,860
Let's go to the sea to service.

179
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:21,790
Oops, you see that we had appeared at EPA, at EPA.

180
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:28,980
And you will think, hey, I wanted to start stop instance, even that is not possible now, not because

181
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,580
we are in a different region, Ohio, Vihar instance in Oregon.

182
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:33,880
Right.

183
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,580
So let's do that.

184
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,710
Let's switch to that region.

185
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,490
Let's go to the instance.

186
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:48,170
OK, not a list of the instance we have given policy to start and out of the instance, but we have

187
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,710
not given permission to list to describe the instances.

188
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:55,740
You see that it is very, very specific.

189
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,330
Point is, if you can't see the instance, how can we start and stop?

190
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:05,460
So we have to change the policies or we can edit the existing policy or we can add more policy related

191
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,530
to existing policy.

192
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,990
So going back to our policies.

193
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,500
Let's find out our policy.

194
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:19,790
Start, stop, jenkins'.

195
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,920
And your policy.

196
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,870
Now we can use again the visual edited and edited, but this time let's do Jason.

197
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:31,330
John, what are you doing?

198
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,700
Again, you don't need to remember things.

199
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:37,660
So here I learned through the recommendation after this, and I'll show you some popular policies and

200
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,190
a lot of example policies also.

201
00:14:40,270 --> 00:14:45,970
So this is one statement over here which will all start and stop the instance, I want to give one more.

202
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:47,200
I'm going to say comma there.

203
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,680
And I'm going to see clipless.

204
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:54,790
Effect.

205
00:14:58,220 --> 00:15:01,270
Allow so I want to allow you to describe instances.

206
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,390
So action.

207
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:16,390
To action, honesty, to the action specific, to describe instance instances now I already know that,

208
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:19,220
so I can very easily write it, but how will you find out?

209
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,310
We'll find out from the documentation.

210
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:24,190
I get the karma resources.

211
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:33,320
Outside just the resource, and I'm going to see all so it should be able to describe all instances,

212
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:42,090
it can list this policy, can list all the instances, but can only start and stop this instance, the

213
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:43,440
specific Aaron.

214
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:51,020
So this policy has to permission both are allow one allow start and stop to a specific instance.

215
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,130
The other is allow describe instances for all the resources.

216
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:57,110
There's no specific order, everything.

217
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,630
Let's review this policy.

218
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:03,500
And let's see if the changes.

219
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:09,450
Now, let's go back to your Firefox logged in and I'm going to refresh.

220
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:19,090
The user only had this quality and you can see the instance, right, OK, in this user, stop the instance.

221
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:23,260
Yeah, there's so many issues going on there.

222
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:27,340
No problem, I can stop the instances, stop, stop.

223
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:33,160
Because you see that successfully stopped the instance at this year getting because not able to describe

224
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,000
so many things.

225
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:38,560
OK, and that's kind of really annoying, I know.

226
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:44,980
But then you can do to go online, OK, and stop this just can't start this with this end user launch

227
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,610
an instant.

228
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:52,360
All right, let's find that out and select already started issues coming up.

229
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,940
You can see the images.

230
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,750
You can do this.

231
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:55,650
You can do that.

232
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:03,880
All right, so if you started coming in Canada, do other things also going on Amway's or volumes,

233
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,369
OK, and keep getting letters.

234
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:13,589
All right, so being very specific, I'll do one more thing, I will find out one more policy.

235
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:16,770
Eatables managed policy and to the same instant, same user.

236
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:17,270
Sorry.

237
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:18,869
So let's go back.

238
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:22,800
And let's go to our user.

239
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:31,690
Now you see that one policy, which I have not been able to do that.

240
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:36,910
This user can change its own password, that's fine, had permission.

241
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:42,630
Adapt existing policy, and I would like to give his three.

242
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,390
Now, I want to give eatables Spanish policy is three read-only exis live, you don't have permission.

243
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:59,760
OK, a user having to policy, one created by us, which is customer managed policy and one eatables

244
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,550
managed policy, this one more, but that will be an their.

245
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,920
Now, let's go back to Firefox and let's go to S3.

246
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:18,030
So Read-Only access, of course, can do everything in list of all those things and click on that.

247
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:27,280
Advocate, for example, and we profiled artifact and files that can access and even download these

248
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:27,850
files.

249
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:29,700
Action.

250
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:31,310
Download.

251
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:40,720
All right, see you fine soldier level access can down, of course, download the files, but can this

252
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,850
user do some great operation?

253
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,580
So files downloaded already?

254
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,410
That's critical.

255
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:53,110
Can we create a folder and see just security with the wrong spelling?

256
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:53,890
But that's fine.

257
00:18:54,590 --> 00:19:00,580
Let's create see, that doesn't have the permission and the really many, many, many things to different,

258
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,130
different ways.

259
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:02,590
It's all based on your requirement.

260
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,380
You can select any kind of permission and allotted to the user.

261
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,130
But be specific, OK?

262
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:10,540
To be safe here, you have to be specific.

263
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:20,840
It is a very nice reinvent eatables, reinvent video, which talks about more into these policies as

264
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:24,120
that's the one I am policy master in 60 Minutes.

265
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:30,990
So this is 2008, a video and this 2019 video of this Norwegian 2020.

266
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:34,970
And that's fine, this really not many changes.

267
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:37,670
You can check this 2019 video also.

268
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:47,260
So I really, really recommend you watch these video, understand practice, this will be, you know,

269
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:52,760
with the workshop kind of so you can do something, what they are doing over there or they're showing

270
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:55,880
like that for many, many services that we are going to see.

271
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,650
I show you the relevant videos.

272
00:19:57,650 --> 00:20:04,340
I have used these videos to loan for my eatables certification exam, security exam.

273
00:20:04,790 --> 00:20:11,090
And these videos helped me a lot in that I am policy is one thing you should really master, OK, when

274
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:12,140
it comes to mastering.

275
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,500
Well, we have to go through the documentation, right.

276
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,130
So let's go to the documentation.

277
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:25,950
So you can go to the AM documentation and it's really in the user guide, access management policies

278
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:31,740
and permissions example policies, OK, the best way I think, you know, instead of going through everything

279
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:37,050
is go with example's policy and you can learn a lot from them and you're going to use them, for example,

280
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:43,110
policies as so many data for the pipeline for Dinamo Debe, for Amazon, easy to, you know, like Amazon,

281
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:46,800
easy instanced to attach or detach volume to this policy.

282
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,340
OK, so it's going to be interesting format, of course, so.

283
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:01,400
Almost similar to what we did, right, but with the condition that I attach and detach the instances.

284
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:08,760
So here you see two star and star to all these instances, not only volumes and instant's condition,

285
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,490
the distance, Aaron, if this is these two incidents, then only that action like that.

286
00:21:14,730 --> 00:21:19,050
So there are so many example policies, astar style policies is also there.

287
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:26,070
Policy for the erm itself, Lambretta for ideas for a three.

288
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:33,830
So you can see some example, politics are and again, simply Google, right, and you see so many examples

289
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,190
of documentation's night falling back to console management console.

290
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,840
So the user group things, we already covered this in political science.

291
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,700
And our focus should be more on policies, how to create policies, your own policy, being specific.

292
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:53,520
And then based on that, you attach to a role or to a user or to a group is always a good idea.

293
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:56,190
Our best practice to group users.

294
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:03,320
OK, so that's all in this video, in the next video, we will be seeing organizations and there is

295
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,360
also a few other policies, legacy policy.

296
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,870
Those will see for the other videos.

297
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:11,390
So let's go to the aid organizations now.
