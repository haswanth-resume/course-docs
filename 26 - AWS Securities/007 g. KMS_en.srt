1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,969
Encrypting your data on cloud.

2
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:09,390
This is about protecting your data at rest, encryption at rest.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:16,980
That really means the data which is residing in your cloud computing resources like S3 Dinamo, DB Ebb's

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,700
ideas.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,920
This data is encrypted in the storage.

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:28,210
We'll be also talking about encrypting data in transit when the data is flowing, but this session is

7
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,840
about encryption at rest.

8
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:32,250
So how can we keep the data?

9
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:38,910
Well, there are so many services in the U.S. that by default provides the encryption like S3 that could

10
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,150
come.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:43,570
It could there are options where you can just encrypt the data.

12
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:46,050
In some places they're even mandatory to encrypt the data.

13
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:51,390
But there the encryption keys are managed by eatables.

14
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:57,730
So if you already have done some encryption without Kamus, that means you have used eatables, managed

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:59,650
keys to encrypt the data.

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:07,450
In this session, we are going to talk about specifically CM's gimmies service, where you can create

17
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,700
encryption keys or just the keys, which it is used for, encrypt and decrypt both.

18
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,440
You can create symmetric or asymmetric keys in Kamus.

19
00:01:18,050 --> 00:01:25,730
And if you want, you can also upload your own keys and store it in Camisoles Soki created by Cames

20
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:28,460
or we applaud the key, we are storing it in games.

21
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:35,000
But where is A.W. storing its keys in the keys that we are uploading or are we creating two games now?

22
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:40,790
There could be compliance that I don't want to keep my keys in the same hardware as the other customer.

23
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,520
That means I have any new account.

24
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,440
I have keys.

25
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,090
You also have a new account.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,840
You'd also create the keys.

27
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,150
Are these keys stored in the same place?

28
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,730
That's virtually practically impossible for the other account to access your keys.

29
00:01:55,250 --> 00:02:02,240
But even though there are compliance and further compliance, you can use Cloud HSM to the cloud based

30
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:10,669
hardware security module so you can create an upload your keys and stored in Cloud HSM, which is a

31
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,600
separate hardware.

32
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,160
And of course you'll be charged extra, much more extra than Kym's.

33
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,910
So Kamus is, you know, follows all the compliance of FIPS 140 to level three, validated as Yasim.

34
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:30,560
So all the popular standards that we have is going to use those and store your keys into a separate

35
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,880
hardware, which will be.

36
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,480
Protected and you can follow the compliance.

37
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,860
They're still not aware about what really deserted and you can just Google, you can find the images,

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,970
Claridges, some device.

39
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,950
Now, obviously, it's not the same if men may or may not be same device, what AWB is using.

40
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,120
But you can get an idea.

41
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,280
It's going to be a separate story.

42
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,360
It's going to be tamperproof and all those amazing securities will be there.

43
00:02:54,870 --> 00:03:01,350
If someone is forcibly trying to access it from the AWB center, it will destroy the keys, stuff like

44
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,650
that.

45
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:03,000
So there are so many compliances.

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,970
Turns out to be very expensive to store it over here.

47
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,980
And we are not going to do that, obviously.

48
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:14,280
So if you ask me, these keys are more secure compared to we put it on normal CM's.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:21,450
Well, not really any of the chemists will be starring in such kind of hardware, but it's just about

50
00:03:21,990 --> 00:03:22,730
the compliance.

51
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:25,980
I don't want to store my keys at the same hardware where other keys are stored.

52
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,330
It's that, actually.

53
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,490
And so those are keys and are being installed on games directly or HSM.

54
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,860
What do we encrypt with that?

55
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:41,040
These are the things that we think we should encrypt as three data ebb's volumes.

56
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,940
You can encrypt with these keys, ideas, data, glacial data, Dinamo Debe EMR and there are a few

57
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,150
other.

58
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,030
But these are the most popular thing you should consider encrypting.

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:56,970
In fact, based on the statistics to most of the data, breach happens because of unencrypted data.

60
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:03,010
So let's do an exercise, will create keys on CDMs and then we'll use it to encrypt our data.

61
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,110
Let's see how that works.

62
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,670
So it was management council, let's just search for CM's.

63
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:16,440
Before we get into this, let me remind you, there is no free for CMS, so if you create a key, it

64
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,370
will be charged.

65
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:21,490
And if you're keeping it for a long, long time, the charges could be huge.

66
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,650
OK, it's not that cheap service, really.

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:29,520
OK, but I still recommend you create the muskies and delete it as I'm doing.

68
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,900
You do the same thing so you not be charged very minimum from a fraction of dollars maybe.

69
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,100
Really, before creating the skis, I will create some users and groups and I will really show you how

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:47,560
this works hand in hand with the erm users who will have the privilege to access the skis, who can

71
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,720
encrypt and decrypt.

72
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:50,320
Let's understand that as well.

73
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,560
That's the most important part.

74
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,510
So we go to a managed his.

75
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,580
You will see the keys that I have used in this region.

76
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,290
This is not keys that I have created.

77
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,470
This is the keys which AWB has provided us.

78
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:12,510
So we can include EBAs or for commercial forestry and corruption or ACM customer managed.

79
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:19,480
These are the key that we will recreate and these are the ones that are charged to this customer store

80
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:26,860
where you can store your own keys and let's go to erm service and let's create some user.

81
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:32,360
So I will really create three users.

82
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,220
So I named them as simple alpha.

83
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,920
Beta and Gamma Jass to make it simple.

84
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:48,440
Look, of course, there will be some real person name Houthi rebels, management control access or

85
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,180
200 Pastorale Keep and.

86
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:58,010
No password reset required, go next side, not give them any policy whatsoever, will do that to the

87
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,310
group.

88
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,920
OK, so I recommend you just, you know, just check this password's auto generated, so you should

89
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,640
go and I recommend you just put it into a knot somewhere.

90
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:12,800
I will use my sticky note.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:20,810
All right, I see it on my sticky notes for now, I'm going to close just now and we will create Group

92
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:22,400
two groups.

93
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,850
One for the admin.

94
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:37,250
And I will give administrator access for this group, REDgroup, next user, next group I will create

95
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,980
and I will see you maybe the protesters.

96
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,730
And next step.

97
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:48,240
I will give this user three full access.

98
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:54,990
And I think you also give me only access so they can access all the services.

99
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,820
OK, here to scroll down a lot.

100
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,690
There is that.

101
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:04,640
It's call.

102
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,460
Scrimps, corkscrewing.

103
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:12,980
OK, OK, Wide-screen, back again and again, that's so weird.

104
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:23,080
If you don't access this route, only access will be uncharitably account.

105
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:29,610
So to policy for the second group, D'Astier Group is three full access and only access admin has full

106
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:31,080
access, let's add.

107
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,260
In the admin will add to the user alpha, so alpha user admin.

108
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,730
You know, like in a wolf pack, I'll fondly write like that in animals like that, our second group.

109
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,840
We will add Feodor to users.

110
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,020
We'll see Beta and Gamma.

111
00:07:54,410 --> 00:08:01,280
OK, so two groups really are one group alpha testers, Group B down gamma admin, as the name says,

112
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,690
administrator full access testers group has three full access and read-only access.

113
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:14,730
I am currently logged in with my RWD account and now I will create keys with my hood account.

114
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,090
So let's go back to our CM's.

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:26,030
How does it create a key, the two options, symmetric asymmetric asymmetric is one single key which

116
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,680
is used for encryption decryption, but ultimately will have a public private key, just like, you

117
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,450
know, you have SSL key players like that.

118
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:36,409
So I'll keep symmetrically and advance auction.

119
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,210
So key material.

120
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:44,850
Do you want to create the key material or would you like to upload your own material external.

121
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,010
OK, but then you have to be very careful.

122
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:53,150
You have to keep those materials, see if you take some backup offered, because if it's gone, then

123
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:53,600
you're gone.

124
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:59,730
One big problem from a security point of view, it's not a problem here.

125
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,050
It is.

126
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:06,860
If you have deleted the key and you have already used that key to encrypt some data, you cannot recover

127
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,510
it ever.

128
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:13,850
So there's also not a new option to delete the keys over here directly, Kamus keys you cannot delete

129
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,980
directly, they will be forced.

130
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:23,640
You have to, you know, enable the delete scheduler delete, which minimum is seven days maximum.

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,590
So many more days.

132
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,870
Minimum is seven days or seven days.

133
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:31,160
You cannot delete a key even if you created it, even if you have full access.

134
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,800
So that's just a safety valve.

135
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:39,050
So in case by accidentally someone disable the key or schedule for deletion, then you can only have

136
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:44,900
seven days to no redo that and not delete it again.

137
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:49,790
Let me remind you, if you delete your keys, you will not be able to recover your data ever.

138
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:54,310
It will be encrypted and it does not hold the keys with them.

139
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,340
So there's no chance you will be able to ever recover the data.

140
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:02,950
So we will not use the external material, we'll just use the Kamus model, you.

141
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,430
You have the other option called HSM that is very expensive.

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,760
Just keep over here on the Kamus go next.

143
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:19,240
Let's give a name I will give them as a V profile hyphen ke.

144
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,740
In C or something like that, like encryption key.

145
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:28,080
All right, and I'll just see you next.

146
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:34,760
Now, permission who will be the administrator of the permission when I say it will be the person who

147
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,960
can control the key, the deletion, the disable, enable all those things.

148
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,750
So I would like to give that to Alpha.

149
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,440
I know Alpha is anyway's the admin.

150
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,180
I will give it to Beta, which is part of ESTOS group.

151
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,460
And Tester's group has three full access and only access, so I will make admin WITHA.

152
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:03,100
The second user, al-Malki administrator Julie Diski, how you keep that check mark on.

153
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,900
Now, you see, that was what I mean, but you can use this key for encryption and decryption, that's

154
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,570
where the magic happens.

155
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:16,440
I give it to be the only beta user can use this key to encrypt or decrypt.

156
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:20,220
No other user can use this to encrypt decrypt.

157
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:21,780
OK, and that's the safety.

158
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:28,670
All right, and you will see that Gameau user also belongs to the same group, but will not be able

159
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:29,660
to use that key.

160
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,830
So let's go next.

161
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,060
So this is really the policy that it creates.

162
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:45,440
And Jason Formato, what are the policies in action create describing right in the camps and who can

163
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:45,770
do it?

164
00:11:45,930 --> 00:11:49,730
Principal by the user.

165
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:53,510
All right, so let's finish.

166
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:01,750
Not the very visible example that we can do with this is with history, but you can use this encryption

167
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,140
key to encrypt anything and we'll keep doing that.

168
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,920
But let's go to history first.

169
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:17,050
And I will create a bucket here with the name of science, some directly related to science.

170
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:23,360
And I'm going to be keeping it in the same region, I have the key also in the same region.

171
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:31,340
OK, now if you scroll down, you can see here is default encryption method, which is disable, we

172
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,950
can enable the encryption of the three Buchard.

173
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:38,540
When I say Nable, I can use Amazon as tricky.

174
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:46,320
Now, this is managed by A.W. or I can use the key Miski for the encryption not remember, we have the

175
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,570
full control on that key, OK?

176
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:51,090
We can decide that this deletion disable enable.

177
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,280
We can set up life-cycle on that.

178
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,680
You can use the sky who cannot use the sky, we can decide all that through policies.

179
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:02,120
So this comes for a three.

180
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:06,110
Also, there are choose from your master key.

181
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:09,110
This is the one that we created selected.

182
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:13,670
You can see or you can see the name we profile and corruption key in that.

183
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:16,400
And I want to see create Buchard.

184
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:24,140
Oh, of course, that will be a common name, people would have used to put some numbers over there,

185
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,110
seven, four, three is something random.

186
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,730
And I will create Buchard.

187
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,370
So I'll go to my bucket and.

188
00:13:39,670 --> 00:13:46,210
To show you the really the visible change first world will make this bucket public, not the bucket,

189
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:49,030
probably actually a an object and let it make public.

190
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,600
So first, let's applaud an object, a file or text file.

191
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,640
Let's upload a text file.

192
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:01,340
So I'm a blue, I'm uploading a file into text file employee contacts, so let's assume that their contact

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:07,160
details of the employees in this file and I would like to upload it now.

194
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:13,520
OK, so use default encryption, Buchard setting or you know, you when you upload an object, you can

195
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:19,370
delete, decide more or other encryption method, but will keep Kamus, which we are using for the entire

196
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,140
weekend and also for this object.

197
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,390
And I will seek upload.

198
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:31,210
I acknowledge that I don't have visioning this is a new thing, I have to acknowledge that I don't have

199
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,360
any enabled and that's fine for now.

200
00:14:36,630 --> 00:14:44,850
OK, that's done now who can access this data, think about it, but we created the IBM user, we have

201
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:48,480
a testers group, Gamma Beta, they have a street full access.

202
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,370
Right.

203
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,630
But the data is encrypted by the Kamus key, which is only accessible by the beta user.

204
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:06,230
So, yes, people in this use in this group can access the history, but they cannot decrypted if they

205
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:08,570
don't have the privilege to, the key to the game is key.

206
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:14,600
Only BITA user has the privilege to use that key for encryption and decryption and of course, the admin

207
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:15,020
user.

208
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,250
So now let's login with the beta user and let's see how that works.

209
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:23,390
Oh, before that, we have to make this.

210
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:33,020
Public, I know, try to make this public and just to show you how it really works, you know, you

211
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:38,060
in making it public, people will not be able to see this reason outside your permission, so.

212
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:39,820
I did.

213
00:15:40,890 --> 00:15:46,410
Local public access, I'll remove that check mark, see if the changes as can form.

214
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:53,050
Yeah, and I will make my object public.

215
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,410
So the object action and make public.

216
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,460
Make public.

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:02,970
So.

218
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:10,410
OK, let's click on the object.

219
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,700
You should have the end point now if I click on Open, I'm opening it with my logged in user, which

220
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,830
is the route user, I click on it.

221
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:24,990
And I can open it, no problem with the of user.

222
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,190
I click with this end point.

223
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,470
Even though this is.

224
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:40,710
A public object, you see, if it's accessed over the Internet, it is invalid argument authorization

225
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:41,820
and you'll see some kimmons.

226
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,300
Yeah, there it to skim S.A.G. require signature.

227
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,780
So see, this data is public, but still people can't see it because it's encrypted.

228
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,440
That's the part of encryption.

229
00:16:53,790 --> 00:17:01,680
Now, let's login with the user so I will see better user and the password that is in my sticky note

230
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,430
and I promise I'm going to delete that those users.

231
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,250
Signing.

232
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:20,220
OK, I can go to three and reduce it has a three full access beta user has the power to access the key

233
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:20,680
also.

234
00:17:21,670 --> 00:17:23,940
OK, access Buckett.

235
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,089
He's an object.

236
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,640
Click on it.

237
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:34,930
And when this user clicks open, it's opening night.

238
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,490
A lot of.

239
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:44,930
It is opening with better user privilege, better use, and also has access for the game is key.

240
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:48,220
So it decrypted entering Mutata, but then.

241
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:55,130
This year, all it's an anonymous access from the Internet, you'll get the same error because this

242
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:58,550
is not the URL for the beta user to access it.

243
00:17:58,560 --> 00:18:00,380
There's no authentication authorization here.

244
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:01,610
It's public.

245
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,060
But the key is not Boddicker.

246
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,550
So.

247
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,750
And that's not possible to see.

248
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:11,250
Now let's log out and log in with gamma yuzu, OK?

249
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,410
That's where you would see the fun.

250
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:19,360
OK, so gamma user does have.

251
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:25,960
The three full access, like the admin user and like the user.

252
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,570
But this user does not have the privilege to access the Kamus key.

253
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:37,160
OK, which is used to encrypt our data.

254
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:45,570
So let's go as keep in mind, I'm Gomaa user, I have full access on these three buckets.

255
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:46,330
Right.

256
00:18:46,390 --> 00:18:48,780
Let's click on that object.

257
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,460
Right now, when I click on Open, I am opening with Gammer user privilege.

258
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,020
And you see that access denied, even though it's public, right?

259
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:04,180
But anyway, here, when I'm clicking it, that's click opening and with the Gama'a user.

260
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,250
So there's no concept of public I'm sorry here.

261
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:09,220
But access denied access and for what?

262
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:15,410
Access for the key galleries that cannot access it, even though has full access to the asri bucket

263
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:18,110
and of course, the end point, any this.

264
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:20,150
Cannot be accessed.

265
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:28,240
So you see, even the data is public and all we're not talking about any public data much, but even

266
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,220
the data is public.

267
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,550
It cannot be accessed.

268
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:33,230
If it's encrypted, that same will work.

269
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:36,850
You know, you have given privilege to this bucket for certain users.

270
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:44,200
So only those users, if those users have the Kimo's access, also Kamus key access, then only they

271
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:44,750
can use it.

272
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:49,460
OK, so what about this user goes to the games, right.

273
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:55,700
And can change things so they're not how about it can elevate its own privilege.

274
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,620
Can you do that.

275
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,910
All right, so that's the key, right, click on that.

276
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,110
Art collection.

277
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,980
So the administrator so let's see, Gama'a user want to make itself the administrator of this key select

278
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:18,710
and remember, Gammer user has access to a three full and read-only access.

279
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,110
OK.

280
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:19,820
All right.

281
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,300
Access.

282
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:23,820
You see, that cannot do that.

283
00:20:25,470 --> 00:20:28,500
Key users want to use the key can can you do that?

284
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,010
OK, do you have to scroll down again, is the error that you're getting OK?

285
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:43,360
So that's the power of interaction with Kamus.

286
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,600
Now, if this bucket happens to be encrypted with a three keys.

287
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,160
So I'll go back as the admin user.

288
00:20:55,110 --> 00:20:58,470
OK, there I am logged in with the root user, I see Buckett.

289
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:04,000
And now what I will do is I will change the encryption mechanism itself.

290
00:21:04,370 --> 00:21:04,680
OK.

291
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:09,920
So let me go to properties.

292
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,840
And default encryption, we're using Kym's, so I'm going to change that.

293
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:21,560
And let me keep the encryption, but I use Amazon is tricky for encryption.

294
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,230
OK, you can see the difference now.

295
00:21:24,130 --> 00:21:27,400
Not Kamus is three encryption keys.

296
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:35,120
OK, OK, I'm going to Firefox, where I'm logged in as the Gammer user, and let's see now what happens.

297
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:44,420
Now, this book is encrypted with three encryption key, not CDMs, and I click on that object.

298
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,420
And I see open.

299
00:21:51,020 --> 00:21:53,960
I think it's still not reflected in that city flusters.

300
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:58,300
Well, I think it's something different.

301
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,890
Yeah, so the object is still encrypted with key hamis the bucket, which is the next object we applaud,

302
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:12,890
will be with that encryption is encryption with the this object, it's still with Kimmo.

303
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,210
So let's change that also.

304
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,540
So log in again with the root user.

305
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,240
And on the object, we have properties here and go through encryption, I will see, you know, use

306
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,820
the S3 encryption, see if it.

307
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:37,450
This got to do with the road user, not go back to the user and let's now try let's refresh this.

308
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,690
Let's see the encryption changed from games to a three.

309
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:42,890
Yes.

310
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,890
Setting aside encryption using extra key.

311
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,330
Let's click on Open now.

312
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:54,860
And you see that works, so this is the problem with S3 encryption key and Kim's encryption key came

313
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:55,750
as encryption key.

314
00:22:56,210 --> 00:23:00,140
You can give privileged who can access the keys, who can use these keys.

315
00:23:00,830 --> 00:23:04,250
But three keys, you know, it's encrypted good.

316
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:06,320
Like from the public.

317
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,640
You're you see the end point.

318
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:11,020
This is also happening, right?

319
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,570
So, yes, it includes the at rest, but when you make it public, it's for everyone.

320
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,960
The key can be used to encrypt, can campaign used, ridiculed by anybody is.

321
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:29,140
OK, now that that was about Ezri, OK, let's let's see S02, let's see what we can do with Ebb's volume.

322
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,450
Ebix volume is also data.

323
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,350
We can encrypt that.

324
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,320
So.

325
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:37,470
Why launching an instance again, like in a launch instance?

326
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:46,720
Just like any time I just take everything, default you to my crew, come on, go next single instance

327
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,650
and storage, OK, they're the root of all.

328
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:53,080
You can encrypt the root volume with your key.

329
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,230
There's an ebb key also managed by the blue.

330
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,370
But this is the key.

331
00:23:57,370 --> 00:24:02,230
And you know, only the user who has access to the keys can encrypt and decrypt data.

332
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:07,240
So you can and the route volume also previously it was not possible.

333
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:08,850
Now we have option for that.

334
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:14,700
And obviously, any other Ebb's volume that you attach, you can encrypt that.

335
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:20,940
Now, whenever there is an encryption option as previous ideas I don't want to be, you will see the

336
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:27,630
key over there will all the keys of your Kamus and you can select that key for encrypt and you can then

337
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,620
decrypt your data.

338
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:32,860
It's that simple, but, you know, it's all about strategy.

339
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:38,320
So I again recommend you watch a eatables reinvent video.

340
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,850
On YouTube for Kamus, I share the link with you.

341
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:45,980
OK, that's 20, 19.

342
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:54,850
Just last year, using egoless games for data protection, access control and audit, so much in detail.

343
00:24:56,850 --> 00:25:02,960
And there's also one more video I want you to see or really watch how encryption works.

344
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,460
This again from Eatables last year, Greenwalt.

345
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,690
So if you have no clarity or clarity or you want to know understand about encryption, decryption,

346
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,310
how it works, what are the keys?

347
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:15,440
Symmetric asymmetric.

348
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,470
You can watch this video nicely explained how encryption really works.

349
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:21,230
And I think it's in two parts.

350
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,710
There's also one more over here.

351
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,840
So go ahead.

352
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,590
Watch this.

353
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,120
Take your own notes.

354
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,230
Do the exercises.

355
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:34,410
And corruption is a very, very serious topic when it comes to data on abuse.

356
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,230
You have to delete as a evolves, as an admin, as a tester, as a developer.

357
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:44,910
So make sure you understand how encryption works and how you can do that on eatables.

358
00:25:45,690 --> 00:25:48,120
And before I close this video.

359
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:55,410
Let's talk about deleting the key again, logged in as the root user, you can do anything as a user,

360
00:25:55,410 --> 00:26:01,650
you can make yourself also as admin or you can give any user admin privilege or not privilege.

361
00:26:02,430 --> 00:26:06,720
But deleting is really not possible directly if you see.

362
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:11,530
Those disable option, the schedule key deletion option, there is no delete option.

363
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,460
OK, so schedule deletion.

364
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:18,830
And you have a waiting period of 30 days.

365
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,630
You know, I recommend you make it seven days.

366
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,440
That's minimum.

367
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,590
You can go less than that.

368
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:24,350
If after the goal is, then that's going to alert.

369
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,000
You will not let you.

370
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:30,720
So once you're done with this exercise, delete the key.

371
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,380
Confirm that you want to delete the keys in seven days.

372
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:37,230
Yes, I confirm that serial deletion.

373
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:44,130
Novitzky deletion, that doesn't mean that you can't cancel that now, you can any time, you know.

374
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:51,810
They canceled mutilation and you have seven days of time, remember, you will not be able to decrypt

375
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,450
your data.

376
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,520
If this keeps going, you need a blue scan to do that for you.

377
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:58,440
OK, support will not be able to help you.

378
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,550
So I recommend you don't just right away go and delete your key force to watch these videos.

379
00:27:03,570 --> 00:27:07,980
There are some exercises and now you can use that anyways for seven days.

380
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,120
It's not going to go anywhere.

381
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,870
OK, so you have seven days of time practice on campus and that is all in this video.

382
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,870
I'll see you in the next one.

383
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,030
We'll talk about encryption in-transit.
