1
00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:07,420
Aimless organization, this particular service is used to group multiple eatables accounts.

2
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:13,600
If you're wondering why multiple eatables accounts as well as Political Alert, it's a good practice

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:19,050
or a best practice to have different eatables account for your different environment, like developers,

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:24,270
different production, different testers and that kind of things to finance different.

5
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,730
So when you have multiple accounts, if you're following eatables best practices, then you lose the

6
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,860
control, they'll be different billings, they'll be different controls.

7
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,980
So the good areas have a master account.

8
00:00:39,670 --> 00:00:45,280
And under that you add all your eatables accounts, which you use in your organization, and you can

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,270
then control it.

10
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,960
What you can control the billing is centralized.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:56,200
So you just be the billing from, you know, you see the centralized billing in the master account and

12
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,230
all the accounts you can then group into.

13
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:05,500
Or you we call it organizational unit, like a finance organization, you can have multiple eatables

14
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,380
accounts and for production you can have a few other accounts.

15
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Now you have enough then Abels accounts of all accounts are used for different, different purposes.

16
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,900
You can group them together, you can create subgroups also.

17
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,750
So it's easier to manage.

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:26,110
Plus, from a security point of view, you can apply policies on the account or on the group or on the

19
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,530
EU.

20
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,330
We call it organizational unit.

21
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:30,930
What are these policies?

22
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:37,620
Well, you have seen in policies now which controls the authorization, these policies will be mostly

23
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,320
deny policy, deny a specific thing.

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,960
Like, for example, I don't want anybody to create access key in a developer's account.

25
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:50,960
I can do that, I can implement that through these policies, I can apply to the developer, will you

26
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:57,230
and every account in that or you can not create access keys will do that exercise.

27
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,140
Also, we can disable route logins.

28
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:07,260
We can see do not no one can make a street bucket public as so many policies that we can apply.

29
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:14,900
So once it's applied from the master account with the EU, it cannot be overridden by from the EU to

30
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:15,800
the master account.

31
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:22,300
OK, it's actually pretty simple to do you could loose organization, agreeableness organizing shows

32
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,220
in your Mostert account.

33
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:29,230
You say, I want to create account or add account Yaraka and then you can have multiple accounts.

34
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:35,590
You can group them together into a new organization units, and then you can apply policies on that.

35
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:43,910
This is more for governing and management of your multiple accounts, but with security policies.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,510
You can really tightly controlled things at a very higher level.

37
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:54,250
OK, so it will look something like this and you have a Mostert account, then you can create or you

38
00:02:54,970 --> 00:03:00,580
can under or you can add accounts like a logging account, developers account.

39
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:04,720
Under that you can create more or use and more account.

40
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
So you can have hierarchy like that and you can create it.

41
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,320
Control policy.

42
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:14,350
Now let's say I want to deny everyone to create an extra bucket or make bucket public and I can apply

43
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,080
on an unemployed applied in or you it will be then implemented on all these sub or use and the account

44
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,800
inside that.

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:24,070
So it's going to be coming from top to bottom.

46
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:27,790
It cannot go from bottom to up like I cannot over ride like a devil.

47
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:28,300
Can't, cannot.

48
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,800
All right.

49
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,810
Those settings, it has to be on this coming from the top.

50
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,490
Like, we have courts and Supreme Court, High Court like that.

51
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,130
In India, that's how it is.

52
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,000
OK, let's see how this works, OK?

53
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,400
So I have to establish account for this exercise, you can create more revenues account and try more

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,860
things, but I would just have to give this account.

55
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:59,150
So this may account will be our master account and I'm going to go to organization, eatables organization.

56
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:03,890
I see you see there.

57
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:09,020
It's pretty simple, it's his account, organized account of life policies that's in place that you

58
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,000
can go to the user guide and you can read more about it.

59
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,040
Its features, its use cases is really amazing.

60
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,670
It is really amazing control on your multiple account.

61
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,810
I really love the service.

62
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,790
You know, like if I said noise free bucket public, then no, nobody can do it right.

63
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:30,980
It's kind of like that security very tightly controlled or implemented.

64
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,890
So secret organization.

65
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,090
Trade organization.

66
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,500
So I've created organization and my organization, I have just one account, which is it's just this

67
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:46,400
account itself.

68
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,880
OK, I want to add other accounts.

69
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:54,280
I see an account so I can either create a new account from here or I can invite in existing accounts.

70
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:56,150
I'll invite I already have an account.

71
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:03,870
So it is telling me to verify your own email account in which I go to my email address under.

72
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:07,910
So I got a meal like this, I a very fine email address.

73
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,530
So it seems my email address is very.

74
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,600
So let's refresh this.

75
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,300
OK, now I can send an invitation, I will either I can give the email address or I can give the account.

76
00:05:27,990 --> 00:05:31,680
So I give the account idea, I'll keep the NMT, I'll just to invite.

77
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:39,230
And now I mean that other account, OK, and I'll go to the organization.

78
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:44,600
It what, our nation.

79
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:45,250
Yes.

80
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,890
I go to invitation and I can see an invitation.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,120
There so I can see the intimidation.

82
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:54,480
Now.

83
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:57,250
Be careful with this, see who is inviting you.

84
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:05,540
All right, and I know this email address, I know this account name and I'm just going to see except.

85
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:07,120
Confirm.

86
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,240
OK, what do you see?

87
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,450
There is one problem here, you know, this account can leave.

88
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:20,570
The organization also logged into account, can leave organization, but you can control that also to

89
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,290
policies.

90
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,890
You can see no one should be able to leave organization.

91
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:29,170
OK, now let's go to our monster account.

92
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:39,130
OK, now you will see the other account, which the account name is Mutualistic, so I can keep adding

93
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,480
accounts like that and then I can really group them together.

94
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:47,490
So you should see it drearier and organize a county route is nothing.

95
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,870
Now I'll see great organizational unit, so I will see.

96
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:56,410
This is as my Cuvee account for my testers.

97
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,940
Great organizational unit.

98
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,680
And then I'm going to add.

99
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:09,710
I'm going to put a checkmark on this, we should move and I want to move it here.

100
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,860
And the U.S..

101
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:19,070
So you see that, and I can tell you and I can hardly and I can add multiple accounts in that, you

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:27,090
know, in this organization we have this particular account like that, again, criminal organization,

103
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,800
accounting and subglacial accounting that in that you can collect more you can add more account.

104
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,400
You can do that.

105
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,360
Now will do the obvious thing, will go to policy, will create policy and apply.

106
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:43,850
This is called service control policy will apply service control policy to or you.

107
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,430
So it is disabled, forced, I am going to see enable service control policy.

108
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:59,220
And here you can create policy that already one policy, U.S. fully develops access policy that allows

109
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,210
every operation.

110
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,190
I'm going to create a policy.

111
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:09,550
Can't you see as soon as they click on created, that shows me Denyer doesn't show me a because that's

112
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:12,040
why it's used mostly to deny some particular thing.

113
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:17,250
So let's take our first example that we discussed.

114
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:22,010
I am so I don't want any user in that account to create keys access here.

115
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:27,860
So I will search for I am as I am and I will find create Huskey.

116
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:37,380
OK, so deny I am critics is key, and that's just one thing I see at Resource, I will say this to

117
00:08:37,409 --> 00:08:42,120
I am resource, all resource and resource.

118
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:47,000
And I don't want to put any condition, if you want, we can put conditions, this is going to be similar

119
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,380
to the I am policy that recruiting.

120
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:52,450
That's a great policy.

121
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:56,590
I have to give the name to the policy I see Denyer.

122
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,650
Exos case.

123
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,500
OK, let's create policy.

124
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:06,700
So I created a policy.

125
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,470
Now let's go to all you.

126
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:21,140
Go to my Oryu and then I will go to service control policy and then you can find your policy over here.

127
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:22,950
This is from the rebels.

128
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,920
SCHRUDER Rebels full access.

129
00:09:25,070 --> 00:09:26,660
It's all it should be applied.

130
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,850
And I want to apply this one also.

131
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:35,470
OK, now let's go to this account and let's see if we can really create access, scheiße.

132
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,780
Come back to this account.

133
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:49,330
This is the account that is in our Kuai or you, and there is a policy applied to it, let's go to Al.

134
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:58,710
Go to Yuzu, let's try create a user given name, just keep it just keep it simple.

135
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,070
Service control policy.

136
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:05,040
I'm testing Coppelia and I'm going to see programatic axis OK, which will create me axis key and secret.

137
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:05,980
Let's see.

138
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,710
Can we do that.

139
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:07,670
OK.

140
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,970
As of now, I'm not giving you policy on anything.

141
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:10,740
Just go next.

142
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,720
And now when I click on Create User.

143
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:21,850
Users created but with errors successfully created the following user, but there are some problems,

144
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:24,910
you see I don't see any credentials over here.

145
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:32,830
So you can clearly use it all here, but that user cannot give cannot be given an excuse.

146
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:34,470
OK, maybe we denied it totally.

147
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:37,790
We just using rules, so no excuse.

148
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:43,560
So there are so many best practices running through documentation and shoyu popular things that should

149
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:44,550
be denied or allowed.

150
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:50,720
For example, service control policy, if you Google it, you can find this link.

151
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:55,900
So General Example's let's go to General Example's.

152
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:08,670
Denying access to the evidence based on requestor region, you can disable Regents' from the top Lolek

153
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,650
do not use this region and their example for OK.

154
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:20,490
Deny and not action, what action you cannot take is a condition strings not equal to this.

155
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,670
Can't you start then?

156
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,600
OK, prevent and use set Senate rules from making certain changes.

157
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:28,630
What changes a candidate so like that?

158
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,460
These are popular examples.

159
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:38,610
For cloud, watch my general examples, then you have conflict, this this is very important.

160
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,640
This is Austin.

161
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,730
The exam questions also eatables conflict, which, if you are eatables config, enable your recording

162
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,600
all the configuration.

163
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:51,660
You don't want anyone to disable the eatables configuration because if you disable, it will not record

164
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:58,410
the configuration and changes or even you don't want anyone to disable the guard duty service or don't

165
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:00,430
make any changes in the VPC, OK.

166
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,400
Or the tagging you can implement.

167
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,860
Hey, we should always have these kinds of tagging.

168
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:08,820
If you try to do something else, it will not allow you to tag those things.

169
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,490
OK, that will be very specific and tags.

170
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:17,520
And again, I recommend you learn more into this and the video.

171
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:28,620
It is 46 minutes of video, it's all worth and you have more videos falling to that so you can just

172
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,740
search on YouTube.

173
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:36,000
I also brought these links managing multiple dribblers account, using eatables organization.

174
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:43,290
Again, really, really recommending you to watch these videos, it will help you a lot to understand

175
00:12:43,290 --> 00:12:47,060
things from a right perspective, from an EWR perspective.

176
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,930
Not from me, not from anybody else, directly from anybody else.

177
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,990
OK, so go through those videos.

178
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:57,140
So that should be all for your organization.

179
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:00,030
