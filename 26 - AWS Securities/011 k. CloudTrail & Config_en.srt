1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:08,500
Well, topic of this video is managing security, monitoring, alerting, auditing, and what do you

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,270
do when an incident happens?

3
00:00:10,810 --> 00:00:16,720
If in general you also talk about any incident, any accident happens, you would like to know how it

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,110
happened so you can prevent it later on while something is happening, like, for example, someone

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:29,020
breaks security, there should be some alarm that triggers and you get alerted.

6
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,700
So innovativeness also.

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:37,360
And any security for that matter, you have tools and services that can monitor for events.

8
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,910
You can track back and see what happened this time and you can even respond to that.

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:50,200
We know clergies and monitoring service or a monitoring service from a W.S. so we can have logs, you

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:53,500
can stream logs to cloud watch and we can read their log.

11
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,170
Mattrick, you know, if you happen to find some IP addresses or something that you don't want in your

12
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,350
infrastructure and it can send an alarm to you.

13
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:11,210
Our response to respond to any events or some cloud really is one source which will record all the entries,

14
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:14,390
all the EPA calls that is made to your eatables account.

15
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,270
So anything that you do in your account, either through console, through command line, programmatically,

16
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,060
all this makes Epper calls to any place and all these calls can be recorded.

17
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:32,790
You can record it in a service called Cloud Drill and then you can save it on an extra bucket encrypted.

18
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,080
I already explained to you about encryption how you can use Schamus for encryption.

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:43,330
So the story is that your story in history books should be encrypted, so not everyone has access to

20
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:48,280
it because the really important information, very critical information in that people should not be

21
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:48,970
able to see it.

22
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:55,870
And also, in case the cyber criminal wants to remove their footprints, they will not be able to do

23
00:01:55,870 --> 00:02:01,390
that if they are not able to find the content industry, but it's encrypted, then the cyber criminals

24
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,490
will not be able to remove their entries also.

25
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,760
So the footprints will be regarded as an lamda.

26
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,750
Services have different EPA calls and their incident.

27
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,370
So they're epicycles.

28
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,110
Their trails can be recorded separately.

29
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:20,760
One more services are going to see in this video the config which will create configuration of your

30
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:27,060
entire eatables infrastructure and will save it, and you can watch the configuration in a time line.

31
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:28,470
What is changed to when?

32
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,570
And you can even have rules.

33
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:36,670
We checks for a particular configuration, like, for example, 22 open from anywhere, if you have

34
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:42,970
such kind of security group where you have put to open from anywhere, then it can even alert you or

35
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:45,690
even can fix such problems.

36
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:52,010
But don't really play too much with this eatables conflict service because it is still very expensive

37
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,330
and you will be charged based on the number of rules.

38
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,740
So more rules, more charges.

39
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,970
So you can do create one rule.

40
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,090
See how it works and then you can just delete that.

41
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:07,160
OK, so let's go to trial first and see how we can record epicycles.

42
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:12,160
So much for the service cloud trail or even just such trail.

43
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:19,950
And here in the U.S., in the SOS, there are some recent events, it will not show you all the events.

44
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,480
If you want to have all the events, then you can create a trail so you can click on create real.

45
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:38,240
Can Utrillo name I see all API calls, something like that, you can do it for all the regions or you

46
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,200
can be honest on the specific region, not Virginia.

47
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,380
I am so I can be know.

48
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,050
Recording only API calls in North Virginia, but recommended, as you recall, obviously all the calls

49
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,750
you can apply at an organization level.

50
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,940
So it gets recorded for multiple accounts.

51
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,110
You have all use in that.

52
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,690
We have seen Eatables organization.

53
00:03:57,890 --> 00:04:03,110
So I'm not going to do it for the organization, just for this account, what kind of events you want

54
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,290
to record, you want to record all or only read-only or only.

55
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,000
Right, or you don't want to record anything.

56
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,470
Obviously, we want to record something.

57
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:11,000
So and we keep all.

58
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:18,019
Also, do you want to record Eatables Schamus events and also, yes, of course, I want to record that

59
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:21,950
maybe someone tries to disable the key so those things can be recorded.

60
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:22,170
Right?

61
00:04:23,570 --> 00:04:29,210
Some log inside also it can record, but that's going to be very expensive, so we can skip that for

62
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,150
now, Astraea and Lambrakis all will not be recorded.

63
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:35,710
But if you want to do that, then you can just do it all here itself.

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,330
You now select only three bucket and record all the API calls and also for Lambretta, you can do it

65
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:43,160
for all or you can select your function.

66
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,750
So we'll skip that.

67
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:50,850
Because this can turn out to be very expensive, also stepstool stolen of a lot of data.

68
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:56,320
So if you're hosting something publicly, there'll be too many calls coming to your city, Buckcherry

69
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:00,780
vehicles and you know, your Cloudera logs will just shut up and you'll have a lot of.

70
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,920
So it really depends whether you want to record this or not.

71
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:04,850
So it is an option.

72
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:10,530
Storage, where you want to store all this so you can create a new bucket that will create an extra

73
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:13,580
bucket for you, but very important points over here.

74
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:20,240
If a cyber criminal makes an attempt to get in, they will also want to remove their footprints.

75
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,520
So you're recording everything through cloud trail, but they can remove your or their logs, their

76
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,300
entries, and you will not find anything.

77
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:30,990
And so first thing is, we encrypted the.

78
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:35,850
So they cannot find I already have a key Miski, so I can select that.

79
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:44,600
And other one is in log file validation, even some makes some makes changes to remove what you can

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,180
run some like commands and you can really check whether the logs are tampered or not.

81
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,360
If it's tampered, it will throw you messages at DDD files.

82
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,740
There's some tampering happen.

83
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,590
If not, your log files are good.

84
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:00,710
You would also like to send email notification.

85
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,100
Still out.

86
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:11,310
Oh, I see, Buchard, I have to give name honestly, Buchard, I will see.

87
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:17,750
She'll logs and do some random number.

88
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,110
Create.

89
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:29,740
OK, it seems I don't have I don't have sufficient privilege to access this key Miski, so I'll go to

90
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,460
CMS.

91
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,510
I find my key.

92
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:38,360
And let's see that it's pending deletion, of course.

93
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:43,660
So instead of canceling that, I will create a new Kamiski.

94
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,070
Is a cloud drill.

95
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,240
IFN.

96
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:53,740
Cames, I think he.

97
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:05,800
OK, house and e-mail notification to my house and this topic.

98
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,690
OK, let's create it now.

99
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:12,710
All right, so that is great.

100
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,190
You should have also created one more whiskey for us.

101
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:23,310
And there it is, so make sure you delete it once this exercise is done or schedule to delete, it will

102
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,090
be deleted in seven days if you schedule for seven days.

103
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,600
So Trelease enable now any any changes to do anything, any baycol we do, it will be record and it

104
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,130
will be sent to the three bucket.

105
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:39,340
So we'll find the AC Buchard.

106
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:42,580
Three.

107
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:52,870
So the FCC budget, we should have a direct Ramblas logs inside that we have the account idea and you

108
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:59,170
have Cloudera Lakshya anyhow digest here when you want to check the validation that time you can use

109
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,130
their digest logs will be here so you will see a different region.

110
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:05,170
I have now enabled for all the regions.

111
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:06,340
I should see all the region.

112
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,830
If you selected one region, you should see only one region.

113
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,340
So 20, 20.

114
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,830
One month.

115
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:22,920
OK, there we have a zip file.

116
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Let's download that.

117
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:35,390
So in the file, you should see some kind of adjacent values, it will be very long is just one line

118
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,929
over here.

119
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,250
If you wait for some time, you will see in every region you'll have a lot of files and you'll have

120
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:40,970
a lot of logs.

121
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:46,190
So if you see here from this account, I read this with this X's, this is the username.

122
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:49,130
Some calls were made and you can really understand that.

123
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:53,090
Who made the call from where the call was made, what service was used to?

124
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,710
All the details will be recorded.

125
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:58,580
A clouting does not support few services, though.

126
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:03,470
Of course, the latest services, a deep learning eatables artifact.

127
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:09,740
We use that in our project that is not supported snowmobile Samarian, but most of the major services

128
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:10,520
will be supported.

129
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,710
You can see all the services.

130
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:22,010
I go over here, all the services, EPA calls will be recorded and you'll see this, most of them.

131
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:29,420
If you want to validate whether you're Cloudera log are right or not going to check its integrity if

132
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,200
anyone tampered or not, so you can use a Calacanis documented.

133
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:41,360
It's an example of lost clout, trail, validate logs start time and time you give you give the trail

134
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:45,460
name and it will print whether it's valid or not.

135
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,500
OK, so the output you should get something like that's going to compare with the Digest and it will

136
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:56,870
tell you whether these low points are valid or not, if there is any improvement happen, you will find

137
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:57,150
that.

138
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,120
So that was what clout will.

139
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,340
Now, if you see all the violence and if you tried all those things, you can delete your Tryal.

140
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:08,230
You can stop logging.

141
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,880
You can even delete the trace.

142
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:21,520
Make sure you delete the Kamus key or schedule the deletion so you don't get charged for it Skidelsky

143
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,230
deletion.

144
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,880
To 70 conform schedule.

145
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,470
We'll check out Naxos, which is the config service.

146
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,360
Just search for config.

147
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,790
Config is really simple service to use, but it's also very expensive.

148
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:54,400
So if you would like to skip this exercise, you can skip, but, you know, you can try at least one

149
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,650
rule and then you can delete that.

150
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:59,620
So let's get started with this.

151
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:07,970
So McLoud trial records, all the EPA calls, config records, all the configuration, the current state

152
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:13,250
of your Indianapolis account, it will record you can also include global resources like AM.

153
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,640
You can mention a bucket name that's going to receive the configuration.

154
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:25,010
And we need a rule, so it will create a rule if you put this checkmark on and let's go next.

155
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:31,580
So that first was about creating the configuration of your own on the second step is about rule.

156
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,560
Do you want to set some rule like one of the most famous rule is Secich, right?

157
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:40,150
You want to check whether any port is such is open anywhere?

158
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:43,940
I like that there are so many other rules in the documentation.

159
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,940
If you go and check, you can write your own rules.

160
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:54,380
Also, you can check whether Valve is enabled, enabled or not in application load balancer or if your

161
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,270
account is part of the organization or not.

162
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,070
Someone tries to leave the organization.

163
00:11:58,070 --> 00:12:01,500
So, you know, you get a notification, right?

164
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:02,150
So like that.

165
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:08,510
There are so many amazing rules that go with a very simple one, which we understand mostly restricted

166
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,350
Secich.

167
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:16,480
So it will check with a security group that are using are allowing this is not for everyone.

168
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,350
And you can from.

169
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,610
Right now, we don't see anything rules if we go, we can see the rules, it's evaluating, it's checking

170
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:29,660
whether it's in compliance or not, your configuration is in compliance or not.

171
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,700
It come back to dashboard.

172
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:33,470
You can see things like Ecija security.

173
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:38,330
Gruder 15 is 12, easy to subnet and how we network interface you roundtable.

174
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,370
How many have network initially?

175
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:43,030
How hard it's going to record all that.

176
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,700
OK, which is pretty awesome if you ask me.

177
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:53,240
Looking at your entire configuration, just one place and you see rules, it says one is non-compliant.

178
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,970
We had to set one rule, if you remember, is a search and is somewhere it is non-compliant.

179
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:58,400
Let's see.

180
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,490
So something is noncompliant.

181
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,940
And that's the security group.

182
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,510
Let's see, what is that security group?

183
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,640
OK, that's the security group, the.

184
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:25,240
So if we go to a rescue, let's go to YouTube and find that security group and let's fix it, this was

185
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,760
created by the Bienstock.

186
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:30,620
OK, you know, the security group of Bienstock 22 open from anywhere, right.

187
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,730
So that should be the problem.

188
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,290
Which is good.

189
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,320
We got to know it now.

190
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,000
Let's call the security group.

191
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,120
Let's go to security group.

192
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:52,680
Right, that one inbound rule, so you should see 22 open from anywhere, right.

193
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:56,040
And see how quickly, how easily it found that.

194
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,820
And we can see that you can send notifications also for that.

195
00:13:59,130 --> 00:13:59,760
Let's fix it.

196
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,790
I'll say 20 dolefully from my IPSC rule.

197
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:08,710
OK, now let's go back in some time, it will see that everything is in compliance.

198
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,980
So it's still not showing it's in compliance.

199
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:16,180
Let's check out Raoul.

200
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:27,890
OK, it is compliant after some time, what you can do is you can also make some changes.

201
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:29,340
Go back.

202
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,250
You can see edit action.

203
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:36,810
Ed.

204
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:45,270
And you can select one dish should really do the evaluation for all the changes only for resources or

205
00:14:45,270 --> 00:14:46,550
for a specific Dagg.

206
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,830
You can do that and no more does an evaluation.

207
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:51,000
Mobiling will be there.

208
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,880
OK, so things are not in compliance.

209
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,330
But I made one more issue, actually, one more another security group.

210
00:14:57,330 --> 00:15:00,890
I put twenty two and I'll wait for it to find that out.

211
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,150
One compliant rule.

212
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:06,980
OK, let's go to security group.

213
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,850
That security group, let's click on that, so those changes happen in the security group, you can

214
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:19,660
see resource timeline, this really awesome thing.

215
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:23,980
It will show you the timeline when your configuration was changed.

216
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:32,020
See that with November 20, 28, this time evaluated and the next change happened at this particular

217
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,820
time, you can see the changes also.

218
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,840
All right, there is a compliance timeline where it will show you when it was it became compliant at

219
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,620
this particular time.

220
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,610
So you can see all the changes like that that's happening on your resources.

221
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:54,630
So al-sarraf lot of not many more things, you can create your own rule, you can put more rules, but

222
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:59,900
I really don't recommend you play in your free direction with config because it can be very expensive.

223
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:06,200
So once you're done with this exercise, you can go to settings and you can see edit and you can see,

224
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,290
you know, uncheck this.

225
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:08,910
So it stops regarding.

226
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:10,730
And Jesse.

227
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:14,490
I can go to rules.

228
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,350
And remove your rule.

229
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:28,700
So keep this for your interview focus or, you know, if you get some task like this, Gafoor, those

230
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:34,850
kinds of things, you keep that information or else, you know, if you try to play more than be huge

231
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:35,300
bull's.

232
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,020
The dashboard.

233
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:42,240
So wait for some time, it will disabled regarding the rule, Williger deleted.

234
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,160
Keep watching that.

235
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:49,290
Clean all this, once you're done, you can check the next video that should be all in the studio.

236
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,250
I'll see you in the next one.
