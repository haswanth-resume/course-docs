1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,410
All right.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:05,160
We did complete the pipeline for staging environment.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:06,840
And you know what is next?

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,770
Yes, for production environment.

5
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,730
So first, starting with setting up production application server, this is staging.

6
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,970
Now before we move, I want to point out here one more thing.

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:21,840
Here we have just one single application staging environment in production.

8
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:28,830
Also, we will be having single easy two instance, but a playbook has inventory file.

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,530
They're right.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,830
And we mentioned just one single server there.

11
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:40,120
And as you can see, we can add multiple servers over here.

12
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,460
We don't need to make any change in our playbook or Jenkins file.

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:44,870
Nowhere, right.

14
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:51,740
It runs on the group and a group can have as many as host it wants.

15
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:55,250
So if you want, it can do deployment for multiple instances.

16
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:56,660
Also it will be same.

17
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,070
We just need to update the inventory file.

18
00:00:59,090 --> 00:01:02,360
That's the power of configuration management.

19
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:03,510
Right.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:04,769
So let's go back.

21
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,680
Let's set up a production instance.

22
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,090
So launch instance, same thing, what we did for staging, we're going to name it as app zero one hyphen

23
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,140
prod.

24
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:18,880
And we will go with open to 18.

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,450
Am I once again open to 18 free tier open to 18 free tier that one.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:31,890
Scroll down rt to micro is fine now we already have a login key.

27
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:36,060
We can use the same, but as for production we use different login keys.

28
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,030
So let's create a new login key and center.

29
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:48,600
It's name will say app login sorry app key hyphen prod pen create key pair.

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,930
Save.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,100
Okay.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:54,430
Moving on now.

33
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:00,610
Yes, we can create a new security group and we'll have similar rules.

34
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,910
So we will just select the same security group.

35
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,040
App Security group.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:13,270
But even if you have a different security group, it will have similar rules and similar steps to select

37
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,350
that security group.

38
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,160
And that is it.

39
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,300
Launch instance.

40
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,800
View all instances.

41
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:26,480
Okay.

42
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:30,290
It's coming up by the time we will add its DNS entry.

43
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:32,720
So let's copy its private IP.

44
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:37,040
Go to Route 53, same hosted zone.

45
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,770
Create record.

46
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Okay.

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:44,570
Before that?

48
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:44,810
Yeah.

49
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,240
This is what we named AB zero one STG.

50
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:59,060
This one we're going to name as app 01prd for product and let's paste it's private IP, right?

51
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,020
Yeah.

52
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:02,860
And they create record.

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,440
Okay.

54
00:03:05,470 --> 00:03:06,730
That's nice.

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,290
Now let's go to Jenkins.

56
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,970
Okay, so I did a shut down and power of the Jenkins, so I need to.

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:20,760
Get the new public IP of Jenkins AT&T.

58
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,190
Let's log in.

59
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:34,940
And let's save the production application server's credential in Jenkins.

60
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:40,280
So total three things launch instance add DNS record add its credential in Jenkins.

61
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,570
So Manager Jenkins.

62
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,410
Manage credentials.

63
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,640
That app login is for the staging one.

64
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,590
Just click on Jenkins here.

65
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,570
Global credentials.

66
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,900
Ad credential.

67
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,810
User name and private key.

68
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:02,740
Okay.

69
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:03,760
So it's the app.

70
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,590
App.

71
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,520
Login.

72
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:07,360
Hyphen.

73
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,110
Prod.

74
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,340
Copy that.

75
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,210
Same in the description I'm giving.

76
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:16,510
Username is ubuntu.

77
00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:27,730
Enter key directly and, and we, we downloaded the login key right while launching the instance.

78
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:29,680
So let's get that file.

79
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,330
I open git bash.

80
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:36,370
I'm going to say cat downloads app key hyphen product PEM.

81
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,950
And let's copy that.

82
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,940
All that content.

83
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:42,220
Once again, be careful while copying.

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,500
Make sure no extra things are copied.

85
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:53,440
Copy going back to Jenkins and paste the content there and say Create.

86
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:56,300
Okay.

87
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:00,620
So we set up everything we need at the application server side.

88
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:04,310
We launch the instance for prod.

89
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:09,570
We updated the DNS record and we have saved the credential.

90
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,380
In next lecture, we will create a new branch and add our production code over there.

91
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,830
So complete this and join me in the next lecture.
