1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,380
All right, let's prepare application, server and its detail.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,240
So three things we will be doing.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,530
We'll be launching an easy two instance with open to 18 operating system.

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:11,250
That's it.

5
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,420
Just launch it.

6
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,940
That is our app server for staging.

7
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,040
Second will create a DNS record for it in Route 53 so it can be accessed with the name from Ansible.

8
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:31,680
So we will save it as a search login key in the Jenkins credentials first starting with launching the

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,220
app server.

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,420
So launch instance.

11
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,590
We will limit as zero one hyphen staging.

12
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:43,100
We will go with ubuntu 18.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,470
You can also use CentOS seven as well.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,940
Our Ansible playbook can do deployment on Ubuntu and centos both.

15
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:54,080
So 1 to 818 I selected instance type to micro is fine.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's create a key pair for it.

17
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:59,900
So you call it US App key?

18
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:01,520
And keep it.

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,930
Pen create.

20
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:03,710
Keep their.

21
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,180
Let's see what.

22
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,470
Make sure that key selected network setting will say edit.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:16,730
And we'll create a security group for it.

24
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,930
We'll say app hyphen.

25
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:20,590
S.G..

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:23,090
And we'll give.

27
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,470
Same in the description.

28
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:32,590
You will see a Lao 22 from my IP if you want to do so just in case.

29
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:37,790
So it will be running Tomcat Service, which runs on port 88.

30
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,090
So I will say allow 88.

31
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,700
Also from my IP.

32
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:50,550
So after the deployment of our Vpro file artifact, we can see it from the browser.

33
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,690
We also need to allow Port 22 from Jenkins Security Group.

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,590
Oop.

35
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,820
Sorry, not in here.

36
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:04,030
Source Jenkins Security Group.

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,949
Okay, now the reason we are doing it, Ansible will be running from Jenkins, and Ansible will do a

38
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,560
search to this application server to run the Ansible playbook.

39
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:18,790
So Jenkins and Ansible are basically just one same instance.

40
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:26,830
We will so we will allow Port 22 from Jenkins Security Group so Ansible can do ssh to it.

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,180
I will write a description.

42
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:30,850
Also allow Ansible.

43
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:34,190
To two such.

44
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,780
And that is it.

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,510
Nothing else.

46
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,410
Just launch.

47
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,070
Tomcat Service will be automatically set up by Ansible playbook.

48
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,420
So we don't need to do anything.

49
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,920
Just launch the instance.

50
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:46,000
That is it.

51
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:49,410
Okay.

52
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,500
It's going to come up.

53
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,140
We got it's private IP.

54
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,840
Now we will go to Route 53 and add it, add in it the DNS record.

55
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,240
So let's search for a route.

56
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,830
53.

57
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:04,230
Let's open it.

58
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:11,000
And here in the DNS management will say create a hosted zone.

59
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:16,700
If you already have hosted zone from the previous project, you can use the same and create the record,

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:19,430
or else you can create a new hosted zone as well.

61
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,670
Like I'm doing it.

62
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:26,540
I will give this name as V Pro File Hyphen Project.

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,210
Sorry, not hyphen dot.

64
00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:31,190
That's how the domain is given.

65
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,260
You can give dot com dot in whatever.

66
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,790
I'm just giving dot project.

67
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:39,030
Private hostages are not public private.

68
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,350
This will be internally used in that region.

69
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,020
So we need to select the region as well.

70
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,950
So we are doing everything in US East, one US hyphen east.

71
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:53,890
I mean, I am doing it in the US East one North Virginia.

72
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,210
So wherever.

73
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,430
Your easy two instances are selected the same region.

74
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,210
Mine is in the US East one.

75
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:05,110
Right.

76
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,230
See this?

77
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:09,080
This is an US East one, not California.

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:16,010
So I use that region and I have a default VPC there that I will select and create hostage zone.

79
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,160
Okay that got created now in this will create a record so let's say create record.

80
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,650
And this will be an A record.

81
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:30,800
So I will give the name app zero one hyphen or app zero one SDG.

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:40,650
And based the private IP over here, the private IP of app server app zero one private IP copy that.

83
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,840
Makes sure app zero one is selected here.

84
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,600
Copy the private IP and paste it here.

85
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:47,870
That is it.

86
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,340
They create record.

87
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,120
Okay.

88
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:55,570
So that is the name of our app server staging.

89
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,200
App zero one stg dot v profile dot project.

90
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:01,540
This we will use in ansible inventory.

91
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,220
You will see how we use it.

92
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,130
Okay.

93
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:10,420
Third thing we will add, it's its search login key in the Jenkins credentials.

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,740
Go to Jenkins manager Jenkins.

95
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:17,670
Manage credentials.

96
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,960
Jenkins.

97
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,610
Global credentials.

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,840
Ad credential.

99
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:35,440
So this will be the username and the private key for our app server, which Ansible will use.

100
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,750
So we will call it as.

101
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,830
App login.

102
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:42,690
See.

103
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,360
I'll put in the description.

104
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:45,880
Username.

105
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,370
So we have launched an ubuntu instance from open to am-I, so its username is open to.

106
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,940
And it's login key.

107
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,830
We say enter directly here and.

108
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,040
And let's look at the key, copy the key and paste it over here.

109
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,950
So I'm opening the git bash.

110
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:07,680
And I will simply do cat downloads.

111
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:09,450
AP.

112
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:11,800
Okay.

113
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,910
Copy that key.

114
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,760
Make sure no extra characters are copied.

115
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,280
Exactly how I copied it.

116
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,410
The same way you do.

117
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:23,330
And then paste it here.

118
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:26,140
And they create.

119
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:32,410
So Ansible will use this credential to login to app server.

120
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,120
So we did three simple things.

121
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,640
We launched an easy two instance app zero on staging.

122
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:41,560
We created its DNS record and we have saved its credential in the Jenkins.

123
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,450
Now we need to prepare Jenkins to run Ansible code that we will do in the next lecture.

124
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,980
So wrap this up and join me in the next one.
