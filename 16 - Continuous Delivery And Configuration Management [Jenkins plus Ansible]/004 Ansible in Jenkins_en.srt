1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:00,780
Okay.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:01,920
This one is pretty simple.

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,240
We need to do just two things.

4
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:10,050
We need to install Ansible in Jenkins and then we need to install Ansible plugin in Jenkins.

5
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,690
So let's do switch to Jenkins first.

6
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,460
Let's get its IP version.

7
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,379
It's.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:18,520
There.

9
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,300
Forget its IP.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:25,660
Go to get Bash.

11
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:26,660
Just do an search.

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,350
To what?

13
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,190
The profile 61 to add the eight p.

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,820
Clear the screen, become the root user and let's get the steps of installing Ansible in Ubuntu.

15
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,990
No, I just googled ansible installation open to installing Ansible and a specific operating system

16
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:49,470
that link.

17
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:52,680
This is the documentation from Ansible itself.

18
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,320
And they're pretty simple steps.

19
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,490
Let's just copy them.

20
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,130
Oh, let's just execute them one by one.

21
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,330
First app update.

22
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:08,840
Okay.

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,470
Next.

24
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,950
App installs software properties common, I believe that will be already installed.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,040
Yep.

26
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:22,750
Already installed.

27
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,680
Adding the ansible repository.

28
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,840
And then finally installing Ansible.

29
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:46,760
And hyphen y.

30
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,420
So what are the steps you see in the documentation use that it might change.

31
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,650
The steps might change.

32
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,310
Just go to the documentation, find the steps and install Ansible.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:05,510
Okay.

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,670
Ansible installed.

35
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:09,070
Ansible hyphen hyphen version.

36
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:13,250
Okay.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:13,770
We're good.

38
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,720
Now let's install ansible plugin in Jenkins.

39
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,340
So dashboard.

40
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,600
Manny Jenkins.

41
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,090
Manage plugins.

42
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,820
Available and search for Ansible.

43
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:31,550
There.

44
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,200
Put a checkmark on that hand.

45
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,970
Symbol 1.1 I'm seeing.

46
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,550
Install without restart.

47
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,830
Yep.

48
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:40,590
That's all.

49
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,750
In this lecture.

50
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:43,190
I'll see you in the next one.
