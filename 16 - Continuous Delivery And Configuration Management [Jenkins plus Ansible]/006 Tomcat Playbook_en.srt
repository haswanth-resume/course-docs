1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,870
Okay.

2
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:10,590
So in previous lecture we have copied the Ansible code in our GitHub repository, in the Git repository,

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:17,310
we will look at that code now ansible code, the ansible playbooks that we will be executing from Jenkins

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:22,620
in order to set up Tomcat Server and deploy our artifacts.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:26,370
In this lecture we will be talking about Tomcat Playbook specifically.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:36,720
So open sublime text editor or Vsco or notepad plus plus anything you want and open your git repository

7
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,820
the folder where you have your get repository.

8
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,130
So I'm going to say file open folder.

9
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,690
So mine is in f drive project git repo.

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:48,960
That's the repository folder.

11
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,230
Select that and I will say just select folder.

12
00:00:53,040 --> 00:01:00,120
Here we have the ansible folder and we have the first playbook site dot yaml.

13
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:04,379
This playbook will get executed and this will execute to playbook.

14
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:11,250
One is Tomcat setup playbook and the second one is Repro app setup playbook which is in the same.

15
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,000
Location.

16
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:16,930
You can also use vs code to view this playbook.

17
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,910
Just open gate bash.

18
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:21,070
Go to your repository.

19
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:27,340
Make sure you're in correct branch and say code dot, which should open the voice code.

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,590
And you have the ansible folder there.

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:35,210
Site, dot email.

22
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,950
Okay.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,800
Now, let's look at this playbook in detail.

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:42,050
TomKat set up playbook first.

25
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
But before we go there, let me show you some templates that we are going to use.

26
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,830
So you're going to provision Tomcat servers.

27
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,120
So if if we are provisioning Tomcat service on a center machine.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,680
Centers or any enterprise linux seven.

29
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,900
Then this template will be used for the system d service.

30
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:12,350
If this and any enterprise Linux six like or six or Article six, we can use that this template will

31
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:18,320
be deployed to set up the init script, the startup script, so we can manage the Tomcat with service

32
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:24,140
command or system Ctrl command if it's open to 16 or higher.

33
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,220
Then this system defined.

34
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:35,510
If it's 1 to 15 or lower than this in its startup script.

35
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,540
So based on the operating system that we have selected for Tomcat, our playbook is going to deploy

36
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,260
the right.

37
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,420
Startup script.

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,690
So now let's go to the Playbook first.

39
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:49,150
TomKat set up Playbook.

40
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:55,840
So this playbook is going to run on a group app server group become yes.

41
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,850
And we are forced to setting a variable tom underscore URL.

42
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:05,570
And this is the URL from where it's going to download the tomcat tarball.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:10,290
And then we have this list of tasks.

44
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:16,050
First task is to install JDK if the operating system is sent to us.

45
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,240
So that will be the package name.

46
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:26,460
If the operating system is open to, then it will use apt module and install open JDK eight.

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:29,280
So based on the distribution, it will install the right package.

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,450
Next task is to download Tomcat tarball.

49
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:36,850
That's the variable that we have set over here.

50
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:43,500
It's going to download by using get you URL module, it's going to download Tomcat and place it at this

51
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,280
location.

52
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,720
Temp directory tomcat hyphen 8... GZ.

53
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,470
Then we're going to add a group called Tomcat with the group module, we're going to add a user.

54
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:03,640
Called Tomcat with user module and no logging shell and its home directory will be us our local tomcat

55
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,140
eight.

56
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:09,490
So when we create this user, this directory will also get created automatically and this will be our

57
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:11,050
home directory of Tomcat.

58
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:19,529
Next we are creating a directory slash temp tomcat eight state directory with file module.

59
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:27,200
And in this directive we are going to an archive tomcat tarball forced so an archive module.

60
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:34,700
So the tarball that we downloaded this location that's the source and destination will be temp Tomcat

61
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,530
eight which we created over here.

62
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,720
And remote source.

63
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,450
Yes, we're using an archive module and an archive module by default thing that.

64
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,590
The archive is in the control machine.

65
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:55,910
So we have to specifically mention remote sources because the source and destination exist both on the

66
00:04:55,910 --> 00:04:56,810
app server.

67
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,210
List files.

68
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,130
Yes.

69
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:05,030
So this honor when we an archived tarball, it's going to list all the files and we are saying list

70
00:05:05,030 --> 00:05:05,300
file.

71
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:05,930
Yes.

72
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,350
So it's going to return all that output and all that output.

73
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,240
We're going to register into this variable.

74
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,340
The reason why we are doing this is when we archive Tomcat tarball which you download it from this directory.

75
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:23,120
When it is an archive then the directory name could be anything.

76
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:27,520
8.5.37 hyphen something 1.2 something something.

77
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,760
It could be anything.

78
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:32,450
So we want to catch it in the runtime.

79
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:36,770
That's why we are storing the output into this variable.

80
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:42,290
And from that variable then we're going to extract the directory name where it get.

81
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,010
Created.

82
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:51,630
So all from all the list of files we are going to store into this variable then that there will be.

83
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,910
A key call file's value is going to be a list.

84
00:05:55,910 --> 00:05:57,710
So first item in the list.

85
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:02,910
So we'll get a complete path and we're going to use a split function.

86
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,640
This works like cut command and so it's going to split at the forward slash.

87
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:12,760
And we're going to get first index, which will be actually the directory name.

88
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,100
So this is going to give us the directory name where the Tomcat is extracted.

89
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:21,010
And which synchronize module.

90
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:27,640
What we're going to do is we're going to sync that directory, which is an archived with the destination

91
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:32,590
user local Tomcat eight and this got created over here when we created the user.

92
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:39,880
So right files will get automatically copied into this destination and this will become the Na Tomcat

93
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,870
Home Directory.

94
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:45,850
Again, synchronize module will think that the source is locally on the control machine.

95
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:53,200
So to make sure it knows that the source is on the target machine, we use delegate to inventory underscore

96
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:53,890
hostname.

97
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,510
That's the magic variable.

98
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,410
So wherever this playbook is getting executed on whatever target, that will be the host name over here.

99
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:06,400
So source and destination both on the target machine.

100
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:08,720
Okay.

101
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:15,540
Next, we're going to change the ownership of user local Tomcat Directory to user Tomcat Group Tomcat

102
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:21,510
because when we archive or when we sync here the files from this directory to over here, it will not

103
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,520
have the Tomcat user ownership.

104
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:30,480
So we'll make sure that recursively this directory has every file in this directory has Tomcat Owner

105
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,500
and Tomcat group.

106
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,760
With Files module, of course.

107
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,530
So now our Tomcat binaries are ready in this directory.

108
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,670
Now it's time to set up the start up script.

109
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,170
So we're going to by using a template module, we're going to deploy our template.

110
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,780
So if the operating system when the.

111
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,380
So here's the condition when ANSIBLE distribution center.

112
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,720
So if the target is sent to us and.

113
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,540
Its major version is seven and both the conditions are true.

114
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:06,280
Then we are going to deploy this template at this particular location.

115
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,510
So that's the system d file.

116
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,400
So then we can manage Tomcat with system CTL command.

117
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:16,200
So in this case, it's going to deploy this template.

118
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,390
This template will be deployed.

119
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:21,680
Okay.

120
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,380
Next.

121
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:28,760
If it's a center is six four, center six, when it's centers and the distribution major version is

122
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:31,760
six, then deploy this template.

123
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,640
Six, that one.

124
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:45,840
So till Enterprise Linux six, it was in its script, right?

125
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,970
So basically that was a shell script.

126
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:53,370
But now things have changed from enterprise Linux seven onwards.

127
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:56,280
Everything is managed by systemd service system dx service.

128
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,650
So we need this file.

129
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:05,000
90 ways for every operating system we have the preparation if the operating system is open to and major

130
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,460
version distribution is less than 16.

131
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:16,040
So 1 to 14, 15 or even 12 older versions of Ubuntu you have, then you deploy this template at this

132
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,820
location.

133
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,910
If.

134
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:27,590
Ubuntu and major distribution version is greater than or equal to 16, so open to 16 or higher.

135
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:31,310
We deploy in this template at this location.

136
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:35,840
So based on the operating system, right template will get executed.

137
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:42,530
And once that happens based again based on the operating system, then if it's open to and less than

138
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,840
16, then we're going to execute this command which is going to reload our init configuration.

139
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,760
If it's centers.

140
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,070
And major version six.

141
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:57,880
Then we run this command check config add tomcat.

142
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:06,060
For a higher operating systems enterprise Linux seven and 1 to 16 greater and higher then we are going

143
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,290
to for for those operating system where major erosion is greater than six or 15.

144
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,330
Then we're going to just use this model systemd daemon reload.

145
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:14,990
Yes.

146
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:22,620
So if it centers seven or 1 to 16 or higher, then this model will execute.

147
00:10:23,850 --> 00:10:30,810
Once that is done, then we use service module to start the Tomcat service and of course enable it.

148
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:34,840
So all this intelligence that we are doing in this playbook.

149
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:43,500
Creating user group and then deploying this template file is only so we can use the service module to

150
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,330
manage our Tomcat service.

151
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,820
So this playbook will set up Tomcat on most of the operating systems.

152
00:10:52,780 --> 00:11:03,790
And so we support enterprise Linux 67012 12 1415 1618 I have not tested this playbook on 1 to 20, but

153
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:07,180
very soon we'll do that and we'll put templates for those also.
