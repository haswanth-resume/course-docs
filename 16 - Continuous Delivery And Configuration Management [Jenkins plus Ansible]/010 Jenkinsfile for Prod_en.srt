1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:00,900
Okay.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,800
In this lecture, we will be writing the code for the production pipeline.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:13,090
But before I start doing it, I need to update the GitHub webhook with new Jenkins IP because I did

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,190
shut down and power on Jenkins.

5
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:19,960
The public IP is changed, so I copy the public IP of Jenkins.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,950
I go to the repository.

7
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:24,770
I'm in that right.

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:25,200
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,620
Correct.

10
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,330
Repository settings.

11
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,950
The books.

12
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,280
Edit.

13
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:34,740
Rendering the password.

14
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:39,860
And update the public IP.

15
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,210
So whenever you power off and power on your Jenkins, you should be doing this.

16
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,030
Okay.

17
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:56,050
Now I'm going to get Bash and we will work on the code that we will be using in the production pipeline.

18
00:00:58,900 --> 00:00:59,260
Okay.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,790
So f my source code repositories here.

20
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,080
Correct.

21
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:09,340
Okay.

22
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:14,410
Now, from this branch, I'm going to create another branch that we will use for production deployment.

23
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,370
So git checkout hyphen b.

24
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,570
We'll use the same name.

25
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,700
We'll just add a prod at the end.

26
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:25,410
Okay.

27
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:28,890
And then let's open the VSE code.

28
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,070
Let me close the previous one.

29
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,090
Exit.

30
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:35,920
Yeah.

31
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:36,460
Okay.

32
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,720
So, code dot.

33
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:41,730
All right.

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,550
So let me close all these files first.

35
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:46,850
We'll open them once again.

36
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,600
Because of here in different branch, broad branch.

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,910
First updating the inventory file.

38
00:01:53,120 --> 00:02:01,070
So change the hostname to correct hostname that we did add in with its PRD.

39
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:01,760
Yeah.

40
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,560
This is what I add in Route 53 DNS records and control.

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,889
As to that, go to Jenkins file.

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,810
And we do not need to build all this.

43
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,150
We will remove most of it.

44
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:23,890
So I'm going to remove build stage test check sonar quality gates.

45
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,780
Upload artifact.

46
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,090
And I'm going to call a delete on all that stage.

47
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:35,170
Okay.

48
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,000
Environment variable.

49
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,500
Also, we don't need these many because we are not using them, so let's remove them.

50
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:52,340
Only Nexus password, which will be used by the Ansible playbook to log into Nexus server tools.

51
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,340
Also, we do not need.

52
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:54,810
Let's remove that as well.

53
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:56,850
Now.

54
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,480
Yes.

55
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,270
You might be thinking that what we are done right?

56
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:01,260
That is it.

57
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,000
We just change the path.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,410
We change the name, change the inventory file, and we're good.

59
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,000
But there's one problem here.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,470
Very, very big problem.

61
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:17,340
So these variables that we are passing in the playbook, this will construct the URL in staging in the

62
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,690
same pipeline.

63
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:25,560
These variables are used to name the artifact so we can use the same variable to download the artifact.

64
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:33,090
But now if we access build timestamp in this pipeline, the timestamp value will be different and there

65
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,940
will not be such artifact with this version.

66
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,310
Build ID also will be different.

67
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:40,440
So what are our choices here?

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,160
What do we do?

69
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,250
Well, we need to have this job as parameterized.

70
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,690
That means we need to take the input from the user to enter the correct artifact name.

71
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:59,340
The user needs to enter the right build timestamp value and the right build ID, which is from the staging

72
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,250
environment, not from the production environment.

73
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:03,990
I'll show you how it is done.

74
00:04:03,990 --> 00:04:07,770
So we'll say deploy to prod and.

75
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:15,600
Let's see things one by one inventory keep same credentials.

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,029
ID app login hyphen prod.

77
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,680
App login hyphen prod.

78
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,850
That's what we saved in Jenkins.

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:31,750
Username admin password of the nexus same nexus ip same repository name, same group are the same here.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:37,140
We are going to mention a variable here which we will take as an input from the user build.

81
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,220
This is our own created variable.

82
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:40,990
Sorry not build here.

83
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,370
We'll set time and here we'll give it as build.

84
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:48,100
Now these variables does not exist yet.

85
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,460
We are going to take input from the user, which I will show you in a moment here in v dot build ID.

86
00:04:54,460 --> 00:05:00,220
So that will be build and here it is the timestamp.

87
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:06,130
So instead of that we are going to use a variable time might seem two variables now these two variables

88
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,690
again they don't exist.

89
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,180
We need to take it from the user.

90
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:15,070
So we are going to add one more stage over here that will take input from the user.

91
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:17,370
So I have the code.

92
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,030
I will show it to you.

93
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:19,170
It's pretty simple.

94
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:28,460
Stage setup parameters, steps inside that script and properties inside that.

95
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:32,360
We have parameters and we are going to say string parameter.

96
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,650
That means the text.

97
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,390
So default value.

98
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,330
So to pair to argument in this default value, we are going to say null nothing, just single code and

99
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,580
the name is build.

100
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:44,900
That's the variable name here.

101
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,310
The variable name is time.

102
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:53,120
Now what happens is when you run this pipeline, it will ask for the parameter the user needs to enter

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,850
those parameter and this will be same as matching as we have the artifact version.

104
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,570
So I'm going to go to next just to show it to you, how the user can fetch the right value for it.

105
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,010
80, 81.

106
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,410
Sign in.

107
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:12,640
Okay.

108
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,140
So we go to browse.

109
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,990
That's our repository.

110
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:18,520
Right.

111
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:23,780
So let's say a user wants to deploy this particular artifact, so user will be passing in the place

112
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:30,530
of build 16 and in the place of time the user will be passing this 22 hyphen zero nine, hyphen zero

113
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:32,900
five, underscore zero three, underscore zero nine.

114
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,960
So you see user can deploy any version of the artifact that is on Nexus needs to just pass the right

115
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:43,820
build ID and right timestamp value so it will fetch the correct artifact.

116
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:48,560
Okay, going back to the code, let's just check the syntax once again.

117
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:53,330
Agent, any environment is this are the stages.

118
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,020
Stage starts here, completes there.

119
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:06,780
Staged Ansible deployed to prod all the details, you know, syntax only I'm checking because we cannot

120
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,620
be really sure whether it will work or not until we execute it.

121
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:13,520
I do control less to that.

122
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,850
And hey, one more thing.

123
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:22,740
I would like to rename this stage dot inventory file to product inventory.

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,110
So right click rename, there is a product inventory.

125
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:32,800
And in the Jenkins file will mention that product inventory.

126
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:37,980
Make sure you change the both place at both the places.

127
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:40,360
The name of the file in the Jenkins file.

128
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:41,760
Yeah.

129
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:42,720
Correct.

130
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,130
Okay.

131
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,490
Let's see if this.

132
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,580
Okay.

133
00:07:45,650 --> 00:07:47,390
It's time to commit and push.

134
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,140
So.

135
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:50,130
Come again and.

136
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,160
Save all and commit.

137
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,160
Let's give a message here.

138
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,890
Prod pipeline.

139
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,890
Save.

140
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,820
And let's put a checkmark there.

141
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:03,350
Nokia.

142
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,830
Publish the branch or publish that branch.

143
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:10,020
It seems like it published.

144
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:11,730
It's time for test.

145
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:14,040
So let's go to Jenkins.

146
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,140
What is my Jenkins there?

147
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,220
Okay.

148
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:23,490
I'm going to copy this name right here.

149
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:29,220
I'll create a pipeline with a similar name if I can copy it.

150
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,420
Command, select it.

151
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,500
Copy Control.

152
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,280
See new item.

153
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:42,530
And here, instead of that, I'll change it to product pipeline and I'm going to copy everything from

154
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,660
the staging environment staging branch, sorry, staging pipeline.

155
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,700
So I just say copy from this one.

156
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,930
So I get all the same thing except I change the branch.

157
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,410
Okay, let's come down and we are going to change the branch to hyphen proud here.

158
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:04,220
So that's the production branch that I created.

159
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:09,270
If you have if you created with a different name, make sure you mention the right branch name here

160
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,460
and really nothing much.

161
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,600
Let's just save it.

162
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,060
Let's refresh this.

163
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,220
Okay.

164
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:22,280
So it's really not showing here.

165
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,120
It's just showing Bill.

166
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,330
Now, it should show Bill with parameters.

167
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:29,220
I think we need to run it once and then it starts showing Bill with parameters.

168
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,770
So I'm going to say build now.

169
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:34,910
And then I want to cancel it, actually.

170
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,640
Let's see.

171
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,450
That works.

172
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:37,900
Okay.

173
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,740
That got canceled.

174
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:40,210
Let's refresh.

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,300
Still nothing.

176
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,940
Let's click on it once again.

177
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,750
Build now.

178
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:47,890
Okay.

179
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:48,200
Yeah.

180
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:50,050
Now it shows build with parameters.

181
00:09:50,050 --> 00:09:54,280
I'm going to click on build with parameters there.

182
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:54,640
Right.

183
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,770
So build in place of build.

184
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:59,290
Now let's say I want to deploy this artifact, right?

185
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:00,610
That one.

186
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,600
So in place of build, which is the build ID, we're going to say 16.

187
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,400
And in place of time, we are going to mention that.

188
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:12,680
Right.

189
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:14,910
Okay.

190
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,250
I can get it from here.

191
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:25,860
And let's say Bill.

192
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,620
And let's look at the logs.

193
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:33,440
Okay.

194
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,040
Wait.

195
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:38,400
No inventory was passed.

196
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,160
It's not able to find the host ignoring app server group.

197
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:48,020
Oh, I see the mistake I've given here.

198
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:49,680
Prod one dot inventory.

199
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,180
Let me check my code.

200
00:10:51,930 --> 00:10:53,070
Yeah, that one.

201
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:54,530
Okay.

202
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:58,140
That was a mistake the file name inventory filing have given wrong.

203
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:02,490
The file name is product inventory, not part one point inventory.

204
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:03,480
I don't know how I missed it.

205
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,910
Anyways, let's save it and then I'm going to commit and push once again.

206
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:14,390
Against some message control less.

207
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:17,440
And put a checkmark there.

208
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,810
Hopefully that should.

209
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:22,980
Come here.

210
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:23,430
Yeah.

211
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:26,970
Okay.

212
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:27,890
Trigger the pipeline.

213
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,870
I'm going to cancel it because we did not pass the parameters.

214
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:31,430
Cancel.

215
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,510
Cancel that.

216
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,210
Okay.

217
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:44,070
Now I'm going to say build with parameters, build ID and that are same what I entered previously 16

218
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,700
and time, which is the build timestamp of the artifact.

219
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,000
And let's say build.

220
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:52,870
Okay.

221
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,790
Let's look at the logs.

222
00:11:58,170 --> 00:11:58,430
Okay.

223
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,800
So I'm going to pause my screen and resume when this is completed.

224
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,090
I'll get one edit and I'll.

225
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,490
I wanted you to see this.

226
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:10,230
This is an apt error.

227
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,840
When we executed the playbook, it was already started the installation of JDC, so it was doing apt

228
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,650
install JDC like that and apt is already busy.

229
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:24,600
We canceled it the pipeline, but the command was already running over there and we tried to run it

230
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,500
once again.

231
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,820
So it is saying.

232
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,190
The big front end lock.

233
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,930
Once an apt command is running, you cannot run one more apt command.

234
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,770
So previous command got executed before we cancelled it.

235
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:39,850
So it is still running.

236
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:43,640
We need to wait for some time or it's still getting the error.

237
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,010
Better a reboot.

238
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:53,250
That server app zero one prod we can reboot, but I will wait for, let's say 5 minutes and then try

239
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,170
to execute the pipeline once again.

240
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,150
Okay.

241
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,500
I think I waited enough.

242
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,410
Let me run it once again.

243
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:09,180
So 16 was that and that timestamp again, take it from Nexis.

244
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,780
We should build.

245
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,590
Let's look at the logs now.

246
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,830
It seems that is working.

247
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,120
Let's wait for some time.

248
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:24,980
Okay.

249
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,960
That completed successfully.

250
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:29,510
I'm going to give it a few minutes and check.

251
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:38,980
The application server, the prod on Port 88, but I'm going to wait for a few minutes and then hit

252
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,580
enter.

253
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,150
Okay.

254
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:47,540
I did wait for a few minutes and just 2 minutes hit enter and you see it is showing the page.

255
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:50,270
That means the deployment completed successfully.

256
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:52,010
We are able to test it also.
