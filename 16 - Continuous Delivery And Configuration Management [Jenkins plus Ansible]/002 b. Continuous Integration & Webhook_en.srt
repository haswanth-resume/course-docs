1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:00,840
Okay.

2
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,540
Welcome.

3
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:04,900
In this lecture, we will be doing multiple things.

4
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:09,100
First, we will increase the Jenkins of volume size.

5
00:00:09,460 --> 00:00:17,470
Second, we will update the Jenkins new public IP in the GitHub webhook and our GitHub repository.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:25,960
Third, we will test our continuous integration pipeline before we continue with the continuous delivery.

7
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:30,320
How to use Ansible, we need to force to test our continuous integration pipeline.

8
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:33,370
If it is working, then we will continue from there.

9
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:41,860
So you can also think of this as the continuation of continuous integration project that we did earlier.

10
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,190
Okay.

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:47,930
So doing the first thing, increasing the volume size of Jenkins root volume.

12
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:52,250
So Jenkins server with a checkmark there make sure the instance are powered off.

13
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,950
Go to storage and that's the volume ID.

14
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,880
Let's click on that.

15
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,980
So we go to the volume section.

16
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:06,950
It will automatically take us to the volume section that is a Jenkins root volume, let's name it.

17
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:12,150
Jenkins route volume.

18
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,070
Now we will be increasing its size from eight GB to, let's say 12 or 15 GB.

19
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,520
The reason we are doing this is from a previous project.

20
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,800
Jenkins would have already collected a lot of or stored a lot of data in the hard disk in its route

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:28,800
volume, and it will get full or it is already full.

22
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:29,560
We don't know.

23
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,980
So we need to do this.

24
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,030
Select the volume action.

25
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,470
Modify volume.

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,520
And increase its size.

27
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,960
I will give it as, let's say, 15 gbps and I will say modify, modify.

28
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,760
Now we have used ubuntu 20 in the jenkins and with 1 to 20 just by modifying the volume size, it will

29
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:56,310
automatically modify the partition size.

30
00:01:56,330 --> 00:01:59,480
Also in the operating system inside.

31
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,280
Otherwise this is just not enough.

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,620
We need to log into this and we need to check.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,280
We need to resize the partition size, but this will be fine.

34
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,580
So that's 15 GB Now I did a refresh, it's so 15 GB.

35
00:02:11,180 --> 00:02:14,990
Now let's go back to instances power on all the instances.

36
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,300
Start instance.

37
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:21,420
So if it's again, if it's 1 to 20, you don't need to do anything much.

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:21,830
That's it.

39
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
The route volume size is already increased.

40
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,950
If it's CentOS or Amazon Linux or Ubuntu older version, then you need to log in access to the Jenkins

41
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,140
server and resize the partition.

42
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:35,350
Okay.

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,250
It's already coming up and we already got the public IP of the Jenkins.

44
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:43,040
We will copy that and we'll update it in the GitHub webhook.

45
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,660
So let's go to GitHub.

46
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,110
Go to your repository.

47
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,040
The same repository that we used previously.

48
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,650
We profile a project that I created.

49
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:55,660
Settings.

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,810
The books.

51
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,670
And we'll say edit.

52
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,070
It will ask for the login.

53
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,150
Enter the password.

54
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,070
That's it.

55
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,750
Let's change the IP.

56
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:12,930
And let's see.

57
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,110
Update Webhook.

58
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:16,860
Okay.

59
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,780
Let's go to Jenkins.

60
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,930
Stake its IP.

61
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:23,890
Colon, 1880.

62
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,580
Okay.

63
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,070
Now I'm able to access it.

64
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:33,760
But if your IP has changed, go to the Jenkins Security Group.

65
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,000
Edit Inbound rule.

66
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,680
88, it's 88 from anywhere, so you should be able to access it.

67
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:47,060
If it's my IP, then make sure you update the IP.

68
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,910
If not, this is fine.

69
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,620
Let's log into Jenkins.

70
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:55,510
Okay.

71
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,840
So we did two things so far.

72
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,720
We increase the route, volume, size.

73
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,690
And we have updated the webhook.

74
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,740
Now it's time to test our continuous integration pipeline.

75
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,110
Now it's already there.

76
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,030
Previous continuous integration pipeline.

77
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:12,220
You can just run the same one or you can create a new pipeline.

78
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Now I'm going to wait for some time.

79
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,660
I'm not going to hurry because I want the next session.

80
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:22,860
So now to be completely up and running stable and then we can test the pipeline.

81
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:24,660
Okay.

82
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:25,720
I read it enough.

83
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,030
So I'm going to say Bill now.

84
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,890
So the same previous continuous integration pipeline.

85
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:40,600
So it'll pause my screen and come back when this is completed.

86
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,510
Okay.

87
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,710
It's a it's a success.

88
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:46,320
My CI pipeline is completely validated.

89
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:48,000
One last thing.

90
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:53,760
We will really validate whether the root volume size has increased in the operating system or not in

91
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,690
the Jenkins.

92
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,030
We will do a search to the Jenkins.

93
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,380
So open get bash.

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,010
As I said, I.

95
00:04:59,130 --> 00:04:59,780
And I.

96
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,430
My key is in.

97
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:08,360
The profile that one open to add the date and the IP.

98
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:09,970
Okay.

99
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:11,320
I won't be able to do a search.

100
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,450
I need to update the security group rule.

101
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,730
Of Jenkins.

102
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,690
Edit Inbound rule.

103
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:22,780
And I have to say 22 from my IP.

104
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:24,160
This is my older IP.

105
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,040
So now it is updated save rules.

106
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,700
Okay.

107
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,820
Let's try again.

108
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:32,680
Yes.

109
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,100
Login, please.

110
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:35,510
I'm okay.

111
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,570
Okay.

112
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,100
Switch to the root user pseudo hyphen I and under five an edge.

113
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,490
Okay.

114
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:45,570
So you see that?

115
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,290
Okay.

116
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:49,860
I need to show this first f desc hyphen l.

117
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:58,650
So that one, that's the route volume, it has increased to 15 GB but then it has the partition achieved

118
00:05:58,650 --> 00:05:59,580
a one.

119
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:09,190
And if you see its size has gone to 14.9 GB, which is the 15 GB, so it has extended the partition

120
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,810
size also automatically.

121
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,810
And if you check the DFI for each.

122
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:16,140
Right.

123
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,690
So the root partition size has also increased to 15 GB.

124
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:27,990
So partition is increased, its partition format has increased and we are good.

125
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:30,870
So we don't need to do anything in the operating system.

126
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,800
It's extended.

127
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:37,890
And if you look at this right, it is 7.4 GB available, it is 7.1 GB used.

128
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:43,530
If it is eight GB, then this will definitely go out of size in this project.

129
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:47,850
So we extended it to 15 GB and that is it now.

130
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:50,340
So join me in the next lecture.

131
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,870
Where we will do some predictive sites on the Jenkins so it can run ansible code.

132
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,100
So join me in the next lecture.
