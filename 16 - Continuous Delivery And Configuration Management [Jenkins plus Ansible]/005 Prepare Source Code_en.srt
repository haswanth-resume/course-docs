1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:01,410
All right.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:03,330
So far, so good.

3
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:07,170
In this lecture, we will be preparing our source code.

4
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,150
So my repository.

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,400
It's here in my system.

6
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,780
This is the same repository we used in previous projects.

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,590
So go to your repository directory folder.

8
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,030
Make sure everything is good.

9
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:27,870
Get status.

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
If there is any changes, you need to pull the changes.

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,770
Make sure the repository is clean.

12
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:36,850
It's in sync.

13
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,230
Let's look at the branch, branch, if any.

14
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,270
Let's switch to see hyphen Jenkins branch first.

15
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,720
Get check out.

16
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:52,480
Sy hyphen Jenkins.

17
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:59,490
From this branch, we will create another branch and that branch will use in this project.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,950
So we'll say get checked out.

19
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:03,810
Hyphen B.

20
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,520
And I will call this branch's CCD hyphen chain.

21
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:11,970
Quince.

22
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,610
Now you can call this branch water.

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,240
You want to make sure you remember the branch name.

24
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:21,780
This is the branch we'll be using in this project for staging environment.

25
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,570
We'll put all our ANSIBLE code in this branch.

26
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:25,730
Okay.

27
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,150
So it creates a new branch and switches to that branch.

28
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,430
And in this branch, we need to copy the Ansible code in this Ansible directory.

29
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:36,320
And that's what we'll do next.

30
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:37,760
We will go to.

31
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,760
Our GitHub repository, not our my GitHub repository.

32
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,090
We profile project repository.

33
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Again, that's the link.

34
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,530
And you need to switch to the branch search for Ansible.

35
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:57,290
In this case.

36
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,380
Ansible.

37
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,860
Their Jenkins Ansible code.

38
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,280
That branch you need to switch to exactly this branch.

39
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,250
Not any other branch.

40
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:07,380
Jenkins hyphen.

41
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,699
Ansible hyphen code.

42
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,760
There are some other branches with names of Ansible, but they have slightly different code.

43
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,480
This is more twisted four or more updated for this project.

44
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:20,810
Here we have the Ansible directory.

45
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:21,260
All this.

46
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,510
We need to copy it into our repository.

47
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,070
So first we will download this.

48
00:02:25,070 --> 00:02:29,420
We will say download zip which will download this branch.

49
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,220
In the downloads directory.

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,040
Let's go there.

51
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,780
Let's go to the downloads folder.

52
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:39,770
Showing folder.

53
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:43,680
And I'm going to extract this one.

54
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,570
Extract all.

55
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,180
Yeah.

56
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,050
Extract.

57
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:52,510
Okay.

58
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:53,730
Extracted.

59
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,050
Close this one.

60
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,440
Yeah.

61
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,480
That's the directory inside that we have.

62
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,930
Directory with the same name and that's the Ansible code.

63
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,640
So you need to copy this.

64
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,720
I'm going to do control.

65
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:11,220
See here, select the Ansible control key and go to our or your project repository.

66
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,900
Mine is in F drive.

67
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,790
In Project Get report.

68
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:20,290
We profiled C Project there and you just need to paste it here.

69
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:21,970
Yeah.

70
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:28,390
So once you see, hear Ansible, you will see a few playbooks, some templates.

71
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:33,340
It is copied if you go to get batch.

72
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:35,610
Right.

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:35,990
Okay.

74
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,760
We'll say it.

75
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:38,230
Ad dot.

76
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,180
So we copied all the ansible code here can get a dot.

77
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,370
And we will see it come at five hyphen M.

78
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,550
See Ansible code as a message and we'll say Git push origin.

79
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,760
Secede, hyphen, chink and symbol like that.

80
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:04,140
Make sure you use the correct branch name.

81
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,320
Okay.

82
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:14,150
New branch should get created now in your GitHub repository.

83
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,290
Yeah.

84
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,030
New Branch CD Hyphen Jenkins.

85
00:04:24,890 --> 00:04:26,210
And Ansible.

86
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,100
Yeah.

87
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,360
And that code is there.

88
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:33,600
Make sure you do all these steps very carefully.

89
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,820
We need to have our Ansible code once again.

90
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,660
It's pretty simple.

91
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,080
We create a new branch in our repository.

92
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:49,830
We download Jenkins Ansible branch from the Profile Project Repository and we copy the Ansible folder

93
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:54,660
from that into our repository and then we push it to GitHub.

94
00:04:56,050 --> 00:04:56,240
Right.

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,330
So the idea is to copy the Ansible code from high profile project repository to our repository in a

96
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,290
new branch.

97
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:06,160
That is all in this lecture.

98
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,170
In the next lecture we will look at the Ansible code that we will be executing from Jenkins.

99
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:14,230
So wrap this up and join me in the next lecture.
