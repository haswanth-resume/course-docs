1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,150
This section is about back end.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,970
So far we have seen in all our exercises that TerraForm maintains the state, but the state is really

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:09,720
local.

4
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:13,300
What I mean by that is it's in my machine.

5
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:21,070
If I'm working in a team and we're using the same code to maintain the state, then I may have a different

6
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,570
state of the infrastructure.

7
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:26,500
If someone makes a change, they'll have a different state of the infrastructure.

8
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,690
The state should be in sync.

9
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,230
So terraform of state file should be same across all the execution.

10
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,840
So for that we need to put the TerraForm State file into a remote location.

11
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:45,730
The best place to use is S3 bucket, or should I say the easiest place to use is the S3 bucket.

12
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,560
But there are a few other things.

13
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:52,630
It's going to be a very simple session, but also very, very important session if you're working in

14
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,290
a team.

15
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,650
Otherwise, there's no point in maintaining the state of your infrastructure.

16
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:06,620
So I just have the excise five, which is same as excise six, except we're going to maintain state.

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,370
So we're going to maintain the state in S3 bucket.

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,280
So we need to create S3 bucket.

19
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:17,410
Let's first put our state information.

20
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:21,660
Backend dot to file name.

21
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,950
I guess all you have to do is terraform.

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:29,440
And in that you have to give back.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:31,600
In the name of the back end service you're going to use.

24
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:34,090
S3 In S3 we have attribute bucket.

25
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:37,600
We have to give the bucket name that we'll create key name.

26
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:42,040
The directory inside that bucket and the region.

27
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,760
If you want, you can fetch this information from variables as well.

28
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:49,740
But let's just first create a bucket.

29
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,520
Let's go to three.

30
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,160
Let's create bucket.

31
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,340
We name it as Terra.

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,690
Hyphen state.

33
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:04,080
Hyphen dove.

34
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:05,780
Okay.

35
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,800
If it says already exists, then try with adding some number.

36
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:12,400
Okay.

37
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,700
That was a unique name.

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:23,500
Okay, so tera hyphen state hyphen dove in this we will create a folder, you name it as terra form.

39
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,510
Okay, so let's copy this bucket name.

40
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:32,570
It's a bucket.

41
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,290
TerraForm.

42
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,580
Slash back end.

43
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,720
So in this file the states should be mentioned region.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:48,420
So my bucket is in this region, US east too.

45
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,830
So I'll mention that name.

46
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:51,270
Let's save this file.

47
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:54,480
And let's now execute this.

48
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,560
Exercise five.

49
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:00,890
TerraForm in it.

50
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:07,890
So as soon as you give TerraForm in it, you see it's a successfully configured back end SX three.

51
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,750
All right.

52
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,640
Okay, let's set that up.

53
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:13,170
Form a validate.

54
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,020
Data form format.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,730
The reform plan.

56
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,460
All right.

57
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,750
And finally, terraform apply.

58
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:30,240
Okay.

59
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:32,120
The resources are created.

60
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,930
And we have terraform of state file.

61
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,340
This is from the previous.

62
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,000
Exercise.

63
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,980
Even if you did, it doesn't matter.

64
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,500
Let's go to S3 now.

65
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,430
TerraForm.

66
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,590
You see the file back in there?

67
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:52,390
Let's click on it and let's see open or you can download it.

68
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,550
See the TerraForm State file.

69
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:58,610
So now the state is remote.

70
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,730
Now same repository used access file.

71
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,810
That's our repository is used by another member of my team.

72
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:09,500
We'll also have the same state he or she makes any changes.

73
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,100
The TerraForm State file gets updated in the pocket.

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:14,220
All right.

75
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:19,370
And same can be sent to the other individuals repository.

76
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,540
So now this will really complete your terraform.

77
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:28,160
State concept maintaining TerraForm maintains the state of the infrastructure.

78
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:33,650
Yes, but when you maintain it at a centralized location, that will actually give you the real benefit

79
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,450
of TerraForm State.

80
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,370
That's all in this section.

81
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:39,860
Let's delete our resource.

82
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,760
And I'll see you there in the next section.
