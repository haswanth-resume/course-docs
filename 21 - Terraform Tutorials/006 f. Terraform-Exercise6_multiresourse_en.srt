1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:07,460
As I told you in the introductory session, that TerraForm is used by many, many different providers.

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:12,950
So you can use many providers like Google Cloud Azure, or not only Cloud.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,260
There are few other things also that TerraForm supports.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:17,610
It has many providers.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:23,010
So if you scroll down here, you can say registry dot, terraform, dot IO come to the site.

6
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:27,980
These are featured provided the main providers ADA, Ada Azure.

7
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:28,760
Google Cloud.

8
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:29,540
Kubernetes.

9
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:30,710
Oracle Cloud.

10
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:32,000
Alibaba Cloud.

11
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:35,110
So let's go to a house.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,340
Documentation.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:48,290
So all the resources that you want to use to maintain your infrastructure are available here on the

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:48,980
left hand side.

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:59,030
And if you see a lot of services and services like EC2, so we used to already write so easy to and

16
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:04,819
in this section you have the resources plus EMI copy EMI to take snapshot.

17
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,990
The one that we used was this underscore instance.

18
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,440
Let's click on this so you can see example usage.

19
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,550
You should really scroll down to see better example.

20
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,250
Okay there.

21
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,490
Now there is a resource for plus VPC.

22
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,920
My VPC and give the CIDR block.

23
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,710
And this resource will create a VPC.

24
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:38,280
You want to create a subnet in the VPC eight underscore subnet subnet V in this VPC.

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,120
And so we are referring to this VPC that we created.

26
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,290
Then there is some networks interface that is getting created.

27
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,000
So there are really multiple resources in one file here.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:52,860
And for instance, the one that we used.

29
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,080
Right.

30
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,920
So we mentioned Ahmed.

31
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,360
Instance type, the network interface you want to connect to.

32
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:04,320
So you're right, In this exercise, we are going to see multiple resources and the good way is really

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,300
to distribute them into different files.

34
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:08,699
If you see a key pair.

35
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:14,460
See that we use that public key and we have not given the entire key.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,970
We use the file function.

37
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,760
I'll also show you functions.

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,990
So you can see arguments, attributes that you can pass to a resource.

39
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,900
So in this exercise, we're going to create VPC.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:31,550
We're going to create security groups and we're going to launch instance in the VPC that we created.

41
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:34,490
And also we're going to use the security group that we have created.

42
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,430
So let's see our resources one by one.

43
00:02:37,550 --> 00:02:39,110
First, VPC.

44
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,630
So I'm going to close that.

45
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:43,610
I can make a search from here.

46
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,620
I can do this VPC.

47
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:49,010
And you have the VPC resource.

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,180
He underscored VPC.

49
00:02:51,180 --> 00:02:58,230
So we're going to use this resource to create our VPC, underscore subnet resource to create our subnet

50
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,530
so we can see it easily example and you can also see the arguments and the attributes that you can pass

51
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,190
in that.

52
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,530
When you create a subnet, you have to mention the VPC ID, right?

53
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,960
So that should be the format.

54
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,010
And the value should be a VPC ID.

55
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:19,920
So we're going to create three public subnet and three private subnet by using this resource.

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,730
We'll also create Internet gateway.

57
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,630
So there you have a plus underscore Internet gateway.

58
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,270
And that's how you can create an Internet gateway.

59
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,010
Round table a underscore root underscore table there.

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,850
So you can create a table like that.

61
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,500
So you really don't need to remember all these things.

62
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:43,630
Everything is there in this documentation and the arguments and the attributes that you can pass.

63
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:47,740
Also, there's a round table association.

64
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,250
So how we're going to associate our subnet with the round table.

65
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:55,720
So we say the resource name, we give the subnet ID and we give the round table ID.

66
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,070
So these are the resources we're going to use in our VPC dot file.

67
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:03,220
So let's create our next exercise now.

68
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:08,110
Okay, so in my sublime text editor, I'm going to say new folder.

69
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:10,380
Excite six.

70
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,310
First thing we'll do is we'll create the providers dot to file.

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,240
Providers dot DFA.

72
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,350
Let's see that.

73
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,050
We create variables file because we're going to refer to some variables.

74
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:38,240
So we'll have the region variable zone variable.

75
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,640
We'll have images.

76
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,260
User variable, also the public key name.

77
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:46,120
So that should be our key.

78
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:51,460
Dovecot Pub and Dove key will copy the same key from the Access five.

79
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,140
Or we can just regenerate it.

80
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,400
In any case, let's just delete the existing key that we have.

81
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,310
Okay, it's not there, but just validate if you're not destroyed it, the key should be there.

82
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,630
It's not there anymore.

83
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,870
So let's also copy our key.

84
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,250
From exercise just to exercise six.

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,520
Jeff, we have the key here now, the private key and the public key.

86
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,300
Okay, now let's create the resource file for VPC.

87
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,680
We leave it as VPC.

88
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:39,640
HTF.

89
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,080
Oops.

90
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,510
Control.

91
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:42,990
C.

92
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,530
F.

93
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:44,250
E.

94
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:44,400
P.

95
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,670
C.

96
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:45,950
Dot f.

97
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,090
Now give it a W, Send us your VPC resource, the name of the VP.

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:59,240
The resource will be def CIDR block instance Tenancy default Enable DNS support true.

99
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,920
Enable DNS hostname true.

100
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:02,150
And the tag.

101
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,590
So these are the properties.

102
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:08,840
Again, you can get that from the documentation or sorry the attribute we call it attribute here.

103
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,840
Then we're going to create the subnet.

104
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,350
It does underscore subnet.

105
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,660
Subnet name First public subnet will create vpc ID.

106
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,010
Now we are referring to plus underscore VPC.

107
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,920
That resource, that name dot Dove.

108
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:26,420
Dot ID.

109
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,250
So once this resource gets created, it will have an attribute called ID and that we can refer it here.

110
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,820
So this subnet will get created under this VPC.

111
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,810
With cider block this map map public IP on launch.

112
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,180
True.

113
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:47,640
So if you launch instances in this subnet, it will have a public IP availability zone.

114
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,230
We will change that.

115
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,370
We will define our variables.

116
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,990
We have zone one like that.

117
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,220
We'll define zone two.

118
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,120
Zone three.

119
00:06:56,150 --> 00:06:57,830
So I'll copy this.

120
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,480
Be it.

121
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:03,440
Okay, so we'll see.

122
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:09,050
Zone two is us is to be.

123
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:14,860
Zone three is US East to sea.

124
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,300
Make sure you confirm the zone name from your account in easy to dashboard.

125
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:20,210
You can check that.

126
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:22,740
Let's save the file.

127
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,710
So we'll see here for dot zone one.

128
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,560
That dot zone one.

129
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,140
Like that we're going to create.

130
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,550
Five more subnets.

131
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:46,000
So the public subnet two things that is that are different subsector block.

132
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:52,140
And that zone will change it to var dot zone to.

133
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,690
And then the tag.

134
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,320
That's second subnet.

135
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,290
Third subnet.

136
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,220
Again, same resource.

137
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,880
CIDR block changes zone is different.

138
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:05,200
And of course the tag.

139
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:07,510
So we're saying these are three public subnet.

140
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,880
Now we have three private subnet also.

141
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:15,300
Private subnet, one sided changes zone.

142
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,710
It's going to be in zone one.

143
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,000
Subnet two again CIDR changes and Zone two.

144
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:31,320
Total private subnet sider changes and zone three.

145
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:39,460
So you can really check from the documentation as well as underscore subnet and you can check the arguments

146
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:46,000
that you can pass availability zone or availability zone ID, you can pass CIDR block mapped public

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,070
IP on launch.

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:53,740
So what you need, you can fetch that VPC ID and as per your requirement, you can put it in your resources.

149
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,410
Next, we'll create Internet gateway.

150
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:06,370
So that's the resource type resource name VPC ID that set Internet Gateway gets created in the VPC.

151
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,470
So we have to join our public subnet with the Internet gateway.

152
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:15,640
So we have to create the route table so we can check the resources of the route table.

153
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:16,720
Underscore.

154
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:16,990
Route.

155
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,980
Underscore Table.

156
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:20,460
Hi.

157
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:26,730
So resource name, resource type, resource name, give the VPC ID and then inside that you have root.

158
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:33,040
So you have to say if the traffic is destined to this, then it can forward it to this particular gateway.

159
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,500
And also you can give tag by using this information, we'll create our resource.

160
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:43,130
So we're creating a roundtable named this.

161
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,120
VPC ID we're referring and we are saying IP address that wants to go.

162
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,550
The packet that wants to go to any IP addresses can be routed to the Internet gateway.

163
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:58,350
Case is a gateway we have creating over here, Right.

164
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:02,010
Dot dove hyphen GW dot ID.

165
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,010
So that should be good for the roundtable.

166
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:07,710
But we also need the roundtable association.

167
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,280
We have to associate our public subnet with this roundtable.

168
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:17,180
So we have the Resource Roundtable Association.

169
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,200
And we it's very simple.

170
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,660
You just mentioned the subnet ID and the route table ID, So if we have to really give it three times

171
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,190
because you have three subnets.

172
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:35,350
So round table association resource name Subnet ID the subnet that you've created previously.

173
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,370
Roundtable ID the Roundtable ID that we have created previously.

174
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:42,700
So this is for public subnet one.

175
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,240
This is for public subnet two.

176
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,030
This is for public subnet three.

177
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,090
So these three public subnet will be attached to a route table and route table route all the traffic

178
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,410
to the Internet gateway.

179
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,260
And there we have created the Internet gateway also.

180
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,520
Okay, so this should create a VPC.

181
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,790
Let's save this and let's test it.

182
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,940
TerraForm in it first thing.

183
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:18,780
Okay, that's done.

184
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,220
Let's do terraform.

185
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,240
Validate.

186
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,840
That's a success.

187
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:31,400
And let's do TerraForm format so we have it properly formatted.

188
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:35,980
Okay, let's check its plan to reform plan.

189
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:41,280
Gates has planned to add 12 resources.

190
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,930
And what are you waiting for?

191
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,740
Let's do it.

192
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,450
TerraForm apply.

193
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:53,360
Okay that completed successfully.

194
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,910
So 12 resources is updated.

195
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,370
And if we wish, we can really go to the console and we can check ourself.

196
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:03,810
You can go to VPC.

197
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,040
A.

198
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:08,190
B.

199
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:08,330
B.

200
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:08,910
C.

201
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,770
Their dove VPC.

202
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:13,180
All right.

203
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,290
The cider.

204
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,240
That's so nice.

205
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,250
Details.

206
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:20,530
DNS hostname enable DNS resolutions enabled.

207
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:23,050
Should have six subnets.

208
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,340
There we go.

209
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,060
Three public.

210
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,960
Three private.

211
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:29,000
Should have the Internet gateway.

212
00:12:30,190 --> 00:12:33,100
Dove Internet Gateway Roundtable.

213
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,780
For public subnet and we should see our three public subnet associated over here.

214
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:46,190
And also the route which points to the Internet gateway.

215
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:52,250
If you wish, you can create the NAT Gateway, but we are going to do anyways that in the project.

216
00:12:53,250 --> 00:12:53,550
Okay.

217
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:56,620
The next resource that we are going to create is Security group.

218
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,170
So let's go to the documentation plus underscore, security, underscore group.

219
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:04,140
This should be in the VPC section there.

220
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:10,080
It's in the VPC section, not the C section, because security group really is the part of your VPC.

221
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,810
You have the example.

222
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:19,950
Resource, the resource name VPC, I'd have to mention ingress and egress.

223
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:28,080
So inbound traffic and outbound traffic mostly we keep outbound as open to everyone, so traffic from

224
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:35,580
our instance can go out on any port, on any IP address, but traffic which is coming in ingress there,

225
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,780
we can put some restriction.

226
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:43,740
So from port here, four, 432, port 443 protocol TCP site block So you can mention.

227
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,420
The IP address or the range or here.

228
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
To allow your traffic from that port.

229
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:55,620
So we'll create a security group because we're going to launch an instance and we need a security group

230
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,460
for it now.

231
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,820
So let's go to our sublime, and now I'm going to create a different file.

232
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:07,950
I'm not going to create it in the VPC file, create a different file and name it as SEQ.

233
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:10,740
Group dot F.

234
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:11,640
Oops.

235
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,420
Not there.

236
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:25,730
Okay, So that is the resource security group, the name of the resource VPC ID.

237
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:29,910
So we are referring it from our this VPC.

238
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,880
So we can refer it like that.

239
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:36,090
You can create things in different, different files.

240
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,320
TerraForm will find it and we'll put it in a proper order.

241
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:45,370
So you see, it has to create a security group and there's a VPC ID here.

242
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:48,210
It knows that it has to create the VPC first.

243
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:51,270
So you don't need to worry about the order.

244
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:55,810
But if you want to, you can specify order that also we're going to see in the project.

245
00:14:56,530 --> 00:14:59,950
But here, the terror from intelligence should be fine.

246
00:15:01,490 --> 00:15:03,020
So the name.

247
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,560
Let's change it to.

248
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:11,050
Dove Stack, S.G. Egress outbound traffic.

249
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:18,580
I'm going to say for all the ports, traffic can go anywhere on any IP address ingress, although I'm

250
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:27,070
going to say 22 allowed from I'm going to say my IP here, but I'll put a variable better var dot my

251
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:31,390
IP and I'll define that variable in my var file.

252
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,120
Edible.

253
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:53,270
And I'll find my IP and put it out there.

254
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,140
And let me see if this also the security group.

255
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,400
And let's test it.

256
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,300
TerraForm.

257
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:11,970
Apply, Or should I say first plan can have included a new resource.

258
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:13,980
So it's refreshing.

259
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,070
The state is checking the state of VPC.

260
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:17,880
It's good.

261
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,560
So it's not going to touch it again.

262
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:22,800
And all the subnets and route table, it's just refreshing.

263
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,190
The state.

264
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,400
It's checking there in the same state.

265
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:26,280
That is good.

266
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,980
Except I need to add one resource.

267
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,940
Everything else is good.

268
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,460
It is saying and that's the security group.

269
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,200
And let's say apply.

270
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,510
Oh, you know what?

271
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,910
You can keep adding your resource and keep testing it by saying plan.

272
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,010
If this is good, then you can go ahead and keep adding resources.

273
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,200
And finally, you can apply the state.

274
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:50,040
Also from the previous section.

275
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,130
Remember, back end maintaining back end is very important.

276
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:58,590
So create a back end, file something like that and put your back end as three bucket.

277
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:04,579
Okay.

278
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,349
So the security group created.

279
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:14,720
Next, we will launch instance in using that security group and also putting in the VPC that we created.

280
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,349
Before that, I will now start mentioning the back end state.

281
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:30,910
Same bucket.

282
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:33,400
I'm using just the film.

283
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,240
I'm changing.

284
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,560
We save this.

285
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:38,300
Also for the provisioning.

286
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:42,800
I will need the Shell script, so I will copy the Shell script from the previous exercise.

287
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:57,080
I already have my keys.

288
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:00,150
Now I can write my instance dart file.

289
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:08,180
Okay.

290
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:11,760
So what we did in our previous exercise, plus a few more things.

291
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:15,870
So we create a key player, key named Dove Key.

292
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:22,560
And we have the public key variable there, which is actually this public key.

293
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:31,380
Let's confirm that once variables Bob underscore key Dovecote pub That's right.

294
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:44,170
Underscore instance resource dev hyphen will see web that's the resource name will give a mid it will

295
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,840
pick up instance type subnet ID.

296
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:53,090
So underscore subnet dot dev hyphen pub hyphen one dot id.

297
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,870
So this is from this vpc dot file.

298
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:04,970
I dove hyphen pub hyphen one dot id is going to return the subnet ID of this particular subnet that

299
00:19:04,970 --> 00:19:05,900
gets created.

300
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:13,450
Keenan We are saying a loss underscore key payer dove hyphen key there dot key underscore name.

301
00:19:13,450 --> 00:19:14,580
So it returns dove key.

302
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:21,430
So it's going to use this key security group ID eight plus underscore security underscore group dot

303
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,220
dove underscore stack underscore is G.

304
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,980
Again, that resource name is from our security group file.

305
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:31,570
Yeah.

306
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:36,850
Dot ID is going to return the security group ID and then some tag.

307
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,410
Volume.

308
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,460
Also, we are putting EBS volume.

309
00:19:42,850 --> 00:19:44,610
It's going to be an extra EBS volume.

310
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:48,280
So some name of the resource availability zone.

311
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:54,460
We have to change this to var dot zone one.

312
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,390
Now.

313
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,370
Our instance is getting created in zone one.

314
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,390
Right this.

315
00:20:01,470 --> 00:20:07,440
Subnet public one subnet in the VPC section if you see this is in zone one.

316
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,260
So the EBS volume should be also in the same zone.

317
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:11,120
Right.

318
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:14,150
In this case, this this variable comes very handy.

319
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,680
So you can use the same variable.

320
00:20:16,130 --> 00:20:16,340
All right.

321
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:19,970
So we create a volume there with three GB of size.

322
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,290
And another resource.

323
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,910
E underscore volume.

324
00:20:23,910 --> 00:20:25,290
Underscore attachment.

325
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:27,920
We attach our volume.

326
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,660
Volume D.

327
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,030
All right.

328
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,540
That is coming from there.

329
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,690
In the instance, I'd.

330
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:38,520
Which is going to come from our instance.

331
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,810
And finally, output public IP.

332
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:48,910
That's the name and the public IP from our attributes.

333
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:55,460
So we're actually using everything from first to fifth exercise.

334
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:00,140
Everything in the six text size plus many more things like VPC security group.

335
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,760
So you are you're actually witnessing multiple resources distributed into multiple files and how to

336
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,840
bring them together.

337
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:11,830
Bringing two resource together.

338
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:12,580
Remember?

339
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:21,070
Resource type resource name dot and the attribute name to ID or kin and whatever is the attribute.

340
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:21,470
Right.

341
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:27,580
That's how you club in two resources together or you refer one resource from the other resource.

342
00:21:27,790 --> 00:21:28,060
Right?

343
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:28,990
Multiple resource.

344
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,700
You need a few more things with this like elastic IP, you can just check the documentation, how to

345
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,280
create elastic IP and then attach the elastic IP, right?

346
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,770
Like we created EBS volume and then we attached.

347
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:43,450
And like in VPC, we created route tables.

348
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,290
All right.

349
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:48,440
And then we have attached the round table associate round table.

350
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,750
So like that we create a resource.

351
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,070
You associate a resource.

352
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:52,650
All right.

353
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,920
And for reference, we use this way.

354
00:21:58,520 --> 00:22:00,240
Okay, let's finally test this.

355
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,890
First, we have to set TerraForm Plan.

356
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,810
Now, first, the validate.

357
00:22:05,810 --> 00:22:07,640
The syntax should be validated.

358
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:15,070
If you have validation error because you're not referring the right names.

359
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,360
Okay, So let's check that and let's fix that there.

360
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:24,560
If we see we have referring a loss underscore instance, dot dove.

361
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:27,800
So what's the name of a resource dove hyphen web?

362
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,290
And over here we have given dove, hyphen dove.

363
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,320
So let's fix that.

364
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,700
They're also there.

365
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,030
Let's find.

366
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:42,750
We have dove.

367
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,190
Dove anywhere.

368
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,120
It's not there.

369
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:47,810
Good.

370
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,220
Okay, let's check once again.

371
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,160
Now, Right.

372
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,250
It's a success now.

373
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,200
Okay, Let's do an FMRI format because it's really a lot of things, man.

374
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,720
It gets formatted very nicely.

375
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:07,580
I love this format option from TerraForm.

376
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,670
It just makes the code very readable.

377
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:13,690
Okay.

378
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:15,780
TerraForm Plan.

379
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,250
So.

380
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:29,400
We have included backend, but we have not initialized it, so we have to set TerraForm in it.

381
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:36,900
So the backend will be initialized because so far we were maintaining state locally we updated.

382
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:39,210
So we're going to say yes.

383
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,470
Do you want to copy existing state?

384
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:41,870
Yes.

385
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,600
Copy.

386
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:47,430
So in the middle also you can include the state, right?

387
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:49,470
But then you have to say TerraForm in it.

388
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,010
TerraForm Plan.

389
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:56,140
Okay.

390
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,730
Everything seems to be good.

391
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,670
Let's finally now apply it.

392
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:06,860
Okay.

393
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,590
That completed successfully.

394
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:10,080
Let's just check it.

395
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,510
You already checked our VPC.

396
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,400
Let's check our C two instance now.

397
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,510
Okay.

398
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,200
That's so easy.

399
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:21,780
For instance.

400
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:24,440
It should be a separate security group that we created.

401
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,250
Yes.

402
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:30,030
And also with an extra volume.

403
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:34,430
Of three job sites and it's attached.

404
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,360
It's attached.

405
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,710
We're able to attach because it's in the same zone as our instances.

406
00:24:39,710 --> 00:24:46,730
Our instance is in US east to a so as our volume should be also in us is to a.

407
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:48,810
Yes, dear.

408
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:54,470
Finally, once you are done verifying everything, just destroy.

409
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:57,600
Your resources.

410
00:24:57,610 --> 00:24:59,770
It's easy to create, easy to destroy.

411
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,030
I love this.

412
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:06,750
All right.

413
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:11,850
So that should give you quite a good experience on how to use TerraForm to do your cloud automation

414
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,790
and how you can maintain the state as well.

415
00:25:16,850 --> 00:25:24,590
Feel free to check your documentation and try a few extra things like load balancers ideas or elastic

416
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,520
cache or rabbit.

417
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:32,270
Q In the project video, I will show you how you can set up the entire stack.

418
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:42,720
We profile as the project that we did, we profile refactoring or re architecture where we used ideas

419
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:50,690
being stack elastic cache, active MQ, and all those sources that we used in those in that project.

420
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,490
We are going to automate that entire stack with TerraForm and also will maintain it state through TerraForm

421
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,710
that will see in the project video.

422
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:01,800
That's all in the introductory session of TerraForm.

423
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:02,810
Thank you very much.

424
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,380
I'll see you in the project video.
