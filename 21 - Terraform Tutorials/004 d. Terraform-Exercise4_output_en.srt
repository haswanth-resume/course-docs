1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,360
Now get printing out the information and also we can store information from our TerraForm State.

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,370
So when we execute TerraForm Apply, it returns a lot of output and that is getting stored into TerraForm

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,510
out of state file.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,380
And we can access information from that file itself directly.

5
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:25,920
We can say we can go to the underscore instance resource, the resource name dot public IP, and we

6
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,360
can find the public IP.

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,430
We can use an output block to print this also.

8
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:38,180
So output resources to print content and we can print out attributes that are already saved.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,950
We can also use local exec to save such information into another file.

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,680
We want to see if IP addresses or IDs.

11
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,050
We can store it into a text file.

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,110
So output.

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,230
Instance, so you can give the name of your resource, whatever you want and value.

14
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,330
You can give the.

15
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,070
Part of the attribute that you're looking for.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:07,990
So resource type, dot resource name, dot the attribute name.

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:14,410
The element is this enables underscore, instance, dot server dot public underscore IP.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:18,970
My C plus underscore instance is the resource type.

19
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,070
Resource name is the server.

20
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:22,960
So as we give any resource name, right?

21
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,080
So like that, it's just an example server and attribute name inside that public underscore IP.

22
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:34,940
If you know how to access that and you can store that information to a text file also by using a local

23
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,960
executioner.

24
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:38,690
We have seen remote exec in the previous section.

25
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,390
Local exec will execute command locally.

26
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,420
So we say, for example, command equal to echo.

27
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,680
Echo is for printing, right?

28
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,180
So you can say print all this content, redact the output to this text file.

29
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,430
So let's then try that.

30
00:01:54,690 --> 00:02:01,360
Okay, so I have here three exercises, so I already have data in the exercise three.

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:05,970
I will just copy all the data to exercise four so I don't have to write all that thing again.

32
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:11,340
And you also don't need to do that because we're going to see only one thing in this printing output.

33
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,070
So let's open our sublime editor.

34
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,340
You shouldn't have case for.

35
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,200
Let's close all that.

36
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:28,130
Okay, so let's say I want to print the private IP or the public IP, whatever you want to print.

37
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:34,910
So we'll go out of this resource block and we'll use this proof output.

38
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,930
And you can give any energy name.

39
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,610
So I'm going to say public.

40
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,610
IP.

41
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,210
Value.

42
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,030
So let's get our resource type.

43
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,290
Ms..

44
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,420
Dot the resource name.

45
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,790
It just dealt in hyphen instance.

46
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,970
And the attribute in that.

47
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:10,640
Now we can find all the attribute from documentation, which I'm going to run you through in some time.

48
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,010
For now, if you want to access the public IP, you can just see public underscore IP.

49
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:23,630
Also, if you want to print the private Tiberius, copy that one more time, we'll see private IP.

50
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,320
Private.

51
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,480
Maybe.

52
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,590
And they attribute.

53
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:34,930
Private IP.

54
00:03:35,690 --> 00:03:38,510
Okay, let's save this and let's execute.

55
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:41,750
Now, it's the same code from our previous exercise.

56
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,440
So it has the provisioning also everything.

57
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,290
So you should have all the data.

58
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:48,890
Same from the exercise three.

59
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:51,480
Okay.

60
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,260
I saved it.

61
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:54,510
Let's go to our banquet bash.

62
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:56,880
Let's terraform in it.

63
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,290
TerraForm.

64
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:01,940
Plan.

65
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,230
In the plan.

66
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:07,180
Also, you can see the attributes.

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:08,880
All right.

68
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:12,090
So two resorts are going to get ADD, right?

69
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,770
Added.

70
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:15,920
So you see the resources you can see there, right?

71
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:21,010
Private underscore, DNS, private underscore, IP, public underscore DNS, public underscore, IP.

72
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:25,030
Right now, it's nothing because the instance is not created.

73
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:32,020
But for a resource before you output, before you put that output block, you can say TerraForm plan

74
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:35,830
and you can find which attribute you want and then you can put it in the print.

75
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,890
Okay, so let's see.

76
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:39,970
Apply now.

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,560
The execution completed, you see the output private IP in the private IP of the instance and the public

78
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,070
IP.

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,540
Only that much in this section.

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,860
I'll see you in the next section.

81
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,290
Before that, make sure you destroy.
