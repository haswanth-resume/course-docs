1
00:00:01,250 --> 00:00:06,270
Okay, so since we have everything set up now, we will start creating our pipeline.

2
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:08,360
Now, our pipeline needs some dependency.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,900
The first stage of our pipeline is build the artifact from the source code and.

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,900
Our artifact will be built by Maven.

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:23,390
So we need to have Maven, and Maven needs JDK Java Development Kit.

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:28,850
Now, we already installed it in Jenkins and in Jenkins we have JDK 11.

7
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:37,070
So before we run our job, before we create and run our job, we need to make sure we have JDK eight

8
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,320
and MAVEN in the Jenkins and I will show you how to do that.

9
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,320
You need to go to manage Jenkins.

10
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,430
Global tool configuration.

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:53,420
From here we can configure the tools that Jenkins will use.

12
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:58,730
There is JDC installation and if you scroll down you should see here Maven.

13
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:01,370
So first lets click on Add JDK.

14
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:05,030
And we are going to give here a name.

15
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,190
Oracle, JDK eight.

16
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,210
You can give any name, but whatever name you give, make sure you remember it.

17
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:16,080
And just to be on the safe side, just use the same name I'm using.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,850
This is just a name here.

19
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,450
We have to select what version of Java will be installed.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,750
Now this is one way of installing a JDK.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,710
You select here the JDK eight and you will get here an option to enter the username and password of

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:32,520
Oracle.

23
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,530
You can create an Oracle account and then put a checkmark and that is it.

24
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,700
You can use it.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,760
But the problem recently, we're having a lot of problems with this.

26
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:46,980
Jenkins is not able to download this JDK from Oracle account.

27
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,700
So we're going to do this.

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,700
We are not going to do this install automatically.

29
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:54,180
We're going to uncheck that option, uncheck this option.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,830
It should be unchecked and we will install a JDK from the command line and then specify its path over

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:02,340
here.

32
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,260
So all you need to do is just switch to the Jenkins instance.

33
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:12,660
So let's copy its public IP and let's do a search to it.

34
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,640
As I said, chive and I downloads.

35
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:24,390
So whatever key you have with the Jenkins, specify that and do a search.

36
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:26,190
So, yes.

37
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,430
Okay, so we just need to run two commands.

38
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:33,710
One is sudo apt update.

39
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,320
And sudo apt install open.

40
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,760
JDK hyphen eight hyphen JDK.

41
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:52,030
So we already have JDK 11 in this Jenkins For our project, we need JDK eight.

42
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,340
So it installing predicate.

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:58,950
So you have to JDK in the Jenkins, JDK 11 and JDK eight.

44
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,110
So but if you run the command Java hyphen version.

45
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,680
You should see JDK or Java 11 being used, and that is fine.

46
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,880
Jenkins runs on that.

47
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,750
That is okay.

48
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:13,890
So how does in the tools we specify JDK eight.

49
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,080
So I'll show you the pseudo hyphen.

50
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,060
I am less user lib jvm.

51
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,140
Oops.

52
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,630
User lib JVM.

53
00:03:26,350 --> 00:03:28,900
So you see in this we have two folders here.

54
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:32,290
One is Java 1.8 and one is Java 11.

55
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,960
So if you're multiple versions of Java, it's home.

56
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:35,890
Directories will be here.

57
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:39,420
So all we need to do is specify this path as the home directory.

58
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,290
So user lib JVM.

59
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,180
Slash.

60
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,290
And this one.

61
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,090
1.8.

62
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,500
Remember Java?

63
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,970
1.8, Not 11.

64
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,680
Not anything else.

65
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,880
Just this one.

66
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:59,660
Get the spot and then we go back here and we just paste the part over here.

67
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,650
So specifying that this is the Java home directory that you need to use.

68
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,000
So this is open JDK and I have given here name as Oracle JDK.

69
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:14,810
That is because later we will be using in our code the name as Oracle JDK eight with whatever you give

70
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,000
over here, make sure you remember that or you can come back and check the name so you can specify the

71
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,090
correct name of the tool that you're using in your code.

72
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,980
But for now, this is this.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,280
Just install open JDK and specify its path over here.

74
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,040
That is all.

75
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,080
Scroll down.

76
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:34,070
Scroll down.

77
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:38,540
Go to MAVEN section, click on Add Maven and this is pretty simple.

78
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,790
You just give the Maven name, so I will give here Maven.

79
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,190
Maven three.

80
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:50,230
And to select whatever three version it is there.

81
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,100
And that's all save.

82
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:56,540
Okay, one more thing.

83
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:02,180
We need to save the Nexis login credential so Jenkins can later use it to upload the artifact.

84
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:04,400
So we'll go to manage credentials here.

85
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,520
Click on Jenkins.

86
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,640
Global credentials.

87
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,940
And you see a button here, add credentials.

88
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,900
Click on that.

89
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Kind keep user name password give the next login username, which is admin and the password that you

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,320
have set for next login.

91
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,580
And give some name here.

92
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:31,750
I'm going to give Nexus login and again, keep the same name.

93
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,360
If you wish to give different name, make sure you remember that while writing the code.

94
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,590
Create.

95
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:42,920
All right.

96
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:47,750
It's time to write the code, run the build job, so we'll go to a VTS code.

97
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,330
Let's click here.

98
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:55,050
Let's go to the Jenkins file and just select and delete everything.

99
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,580
We'll write it from the scratch.

100
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,820
So first is Pipeline.

101
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,520
Open and close.

102
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:02,550
Bring it down.

103
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,710
Agent any.

104
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:11,250
So it can run directly on Jenkins without mentioning any agent.

105
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,690
Tools.

106
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,760
We are using two tools here.

107
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,030
One is Maven.

108
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:21,200
The other one is JDC.

109
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:27,780
So make sure you give the same name that you have added in the Jenkins MAVEN three Oracle JDK eight

110
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:31,620
next stages.

111
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:35,040
And in that we will have the stage.

112
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,320
Which is for the build.

113
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,100
In that stage.

114
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,870
We have the steps.

115
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,260
And it is going to be a shell command.

116
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,400
Maven.

117
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,060
Come on.

118
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,620
Which is this?

119
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,540
Make sure you put it in single code.

120
00:06:57,570 --> 00:07:00,600
MV and hyphen SX settings dot xml.

121
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,430
We'll go to that file in a moment.

122
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,920
Hyphen the skipped test.

123
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:06,870
So it is not going to run any test.

124
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:13,470
So basically it's going to run an install while it is doing it is going to pass some settings and it

125
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:14,880
will skip the unit test.

126
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:21,570
Now about the settings, now we want our maven to download dependencies from Nexus.

127
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,440
And that is specified in the XML file.

128
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,800
If you click on this XML file, scroll down.

129
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:34,040
At the end you see here repository.

130
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:36,110
The section.

131
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,070
Repositories repository ID.

132
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,120
There is a variable.

133
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:48,050
We will be defining all these variables so the ID and the URL from where to download the dependency.

134
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,650
So that is the URL and these are the variables.

135
00:07:51,650 --> 00:07:52,790
We will be replacing it with.

136
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,070
The values will mention the variables.

137
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,720
It will replace it with the value.

138
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,820
So next this group repository URL from where it is going to download all the dependencies.

139
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:07,280
Now, while it wants to download, it also needs other details like what is your proxy repository?

140
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,780
What is the username password?

141
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,680
All those things.

142
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,740
These details are mentioned in the settings XML file.

143
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,760
In the settings dot XML file, you have servers.

144
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,020
Here we have the snapshot repository.

145
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,640
It's username and password.

146
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:28,420
So this is the nexus username and password release Repository Central repository and group repository.

147
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,039
So in the mirrors here we have the central repository.

148
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,260
So this is supposed to be the proxy, but we grouped the repository together.

149
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:43,870
So it's going to be the group repository URL and for the authentication, it will take it from here.

150
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,400
Now, if you're a Java guy, you'll understand it very quickly.

151
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,170
If you are not, do not worry.

152
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:52,800
It's pretty simple, this opening and closing you need to remember.

153
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,510
Mirrors, for example, mirrors.

154
00:08:55,510 --> 00:08:59,110
And that's the opening and slash mirrors.

155
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,410
In those symbol.

156
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:02,850
This is the closing.

157
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:04,230
Then the mirrors you have.

158
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,140
Mirror, mirror.

159
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:08,070
This is the opening and this is the closing.

160
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,550
You will have an ID here for the mirror.

161
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,180
The name of the mirror, The URL of the mirror.

162
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:23,250
Now the word a mirror is generally used for the URL of a repository or information about a repository.

163
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,860
In Java and Linux.

164
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,210
That's the word used.

165
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:30,670
And then like that you have server section here.

166
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:35,650
If you go back to XML, you have your repository section opening and closing.

167
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:36,850
You need to remember that.

168
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:38,440
So once again.

169
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:45,100
Maven is going to look for the repository, this URL for the information that is going to go to the

170
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:51,190
settings dot XML, get the information from here mirrors and its authentication and server information

171
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,840
from the server entries.

172
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:55,540
But one piece here is missing.

173
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,480
Still, we have the variables here.

174
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,510
These are all the variables dollar and the curly brace.

175
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:06,430
These are the variables we need to define these variables that we will define in the Jenkins file.

176
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,940
So just before the stages section here.

177
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:10,840
Over here.

178
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:15,480
I will say environment open and close.

179
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,900
And I'll define all the variables that is used in settings dot XML and XML file.

180
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,250
There.

181
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,110
That was quick.

182
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:25,370
I know.

183
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,280
I just copy paste it.

184
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:31,650
But you can also do if you copy paste if you want, you can use this Jenkins file from the resource

185
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,480
section, but I recommend you type.

186
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:37,770
So snappy repo variable value is this v pro file hyphen snapshot.

187
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:41,130
This is the repository that we created in nexus right?

188
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,690
Nexus Username.

189
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:50,190
Nexus Password Release Repository name Central Repository name nexus IP that I need to change.

190
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,570
Also you need to change.

191
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,640
So let's go to easy to console.

192
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,300
Nexus and get the private you can not the public IP, private IP.

193
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,690
They are in the same network.

194
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,980
They connect with each other with private IP.

195
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:12,610
So just give the private IP for data at one Nexus group Repository Name Nexus login.

196
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,500
This we will be using later.

197
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,880
Not now, but still.

198
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:18,430
I have given you already added the credential.

199
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,680
This is the Nexus login credential name.

200
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,300
They are in the jenkins.

201
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,160
We added nexus login credential.

202
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,490
Just check once again opening and closing properly.

203
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,980
Pipeline opens here and there.

204
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:33,100
It closes so it highlights stages.

205
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:37,120
Opening and closing this one stage here, click on that.

206
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,730
That's the stage steps also for the environment variable opening and closing.

207
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:46,480
So if you click on that curly brace right, it will show you the ending.

208
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,250
Curly brace closing.

209
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,750
Curly All right.

210
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,240
For the tools, we are good.

211
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,780
I'm going to click on control SCE hit control s on your keyboard.

212
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,440
Save it.

213
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:58,140
Right.

214
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,260
There goes.

215
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:04,460
Okay, Drop down, comment and push.

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:06,340
So, yes.

217
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,520
You will commit message, I will say including.

218
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,750
Build, job save.

219
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,230
So now we have to click on this checkmark.

220
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,980
Yeah.

221
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:23,840
Okay.

222
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:25,290
It's pushing the change.

223
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,370
Okay, that's done.

224
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,830
Let's go to now Jenkins and finally create the job that we wanted from a long time.

225
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,770
At least I wanted to do it for a long time.

226
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,510
Click on New item.

227
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,360
Let's give a name.

228
00:12:41,390 --> 00:12:43,850
We profile CI pipeline.

229
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:48,680
I will keep all small caps and small create confusion.

230
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,300
So let's keep all small here.

231
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:53,150
Click on Pipeline.

232
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,000
Say, okay.

233
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:58,450
Okay, Come down.

234
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,880
Pipeline Script.

235
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,040
Pipeline script from Sxm.

236
00:13:03,090 --> 00:13:04,000
Click on that.

237
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,960
And we select here get.

238
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,930
And we give a repository.

239
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,440
So let's go to our GitHub repository.

240
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,290
Not the Vpro file repository.

241
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:20,280
This is your own repository, right?

242
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,580
Can that.

243
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:24,980
Yeah, that's the repository that we created.

244
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,010
Click on this dropdown code and search.

245
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:29,780
Copy that URL.

246
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,080
Go back to Jenkins.

247
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,150
The you are here now.

248
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,800
In a moment, it's going to throw an error.

249
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:39,120
Yeah, that one.

250
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,040
And we'll fix that.

251
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,410
Let's add the credentials here.

252
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,230
So add.

253
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:48,960
Jenkins.

254
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,820
Now we authenticate with our GitHub account with the Keys search key that we have saved here.

255
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,750
We saved the public key and we need to store the private key here.

256
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:05,040
So on the kind, say a search username with private key.

257
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:11,060
I'd let's say GitHub log in description.

258
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,590
I also a GitHub login.

259
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:15,050
Username get.

260
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,200
And private key.

261
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:19,200
Click on Enter directly here.

262
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:26,520
Ad and you need to paste the private key over here that we created previously.

263
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,350
Okay, I can clear the screen.

264
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:39,890
Okay, so cat, tilde, slash dot search, slash, ID, underscore RSA.

265
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,510
This is the private key.

266
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:43,890
Copied properly.

267
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,250
No extra space.

268
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:49,420
Right.

269
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,830
Copy here.

270
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,480
Right click.

271
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,650
Copy.

272
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,390
Look at the path once again.

273
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:59,560
This is the key that we created previously and paste it here.

274
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:04,380
So Jenkins will also use the same key to authenticate your GitHub account.

275
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,230
Say add.

276
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,970
And select your credential.

277
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:12,420
Okay, that's done.

278
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,010
But this error is still not going.

279
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:17,220
This is because it is doing search and it is asking a question.

280
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,510
Do you want to connect it?

281
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,260
Yes or no?

282
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,960
And Jenkins cannot answer that behind the scene.

283
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:28,530
So we need to search to the Jenkins and make sure we store the GitHub identity.

284
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,420
So get.

285
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:33,420
The Jenkins Public IP.

286
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:40,510
And so such hyphen I tilde slash downloads the profile.

287
00:15:41,870 --> 00:15:46,530
It's a high profile city open to trade IP.

288
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:48,620
So a search to the Jenkins server.

289
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,640
Strange.

290
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,410
I think I copied the wrong IP.

291
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:57,530
Now I will correct the username I have given wrong.

292
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,110
Open to spelling mistake there.

293
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,040
Yeah.

294
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,410
Okay, clear the screen.

295
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,390
Switch to route user.

296
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:10,030
From here you have to switch to the Jenkins user.

297
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:13,540
There is a Jenkins user that is trying to do a search to GitHub account.

298
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,830
And here to run this command.

299
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:21,830
Replace this URL with your GitHub account.

300
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,500
Copy the repository URL.

301
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,470
Okay.

302
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,100
Lets hate enter here.

303
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:37,060
Yeah.

304
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,990
And say yes.

305
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:42,160
So it stores the identity of GitHub into the Jenkins user.

306
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,670
This is where it will store such known host.

307
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,170
Now, it will give you this error.

308
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:52,520
But don't worry, we don't want to log into that GitHub account here.

309
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:54,550
We just wanted to store the identity key.

310
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:55,680
That's done.

311
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,720
Now let's go back to Jenkins.

312
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,710
Okay.

313
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:05,240
All right, let's do one.

314
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:08,440
Yeah.

315
00:17:08,650 --> 00:17:13,420
You switch the credentials or you can refresh, but just switch the credential and you will see the

316
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,380
error goes away.

317
00:17:15,369 --> 00:17:18,079
Okay, Come down and make sure you give your branches.

318
00:17:18,099 --> 00:17:19,329
Sy hyphen Jenkins.

319
00:17:19,339 --> 00:17:20,980
You do not have a master branch.

320
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,380
You have the branch ci hyphen jenkins.

321
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:26,530
And in that branch we have the Jenkins file.

322
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:27,819
Right.

323
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,500
Jacob Jenkins file.

324
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,850
That's in our repository.

325
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,590
So it's going to fetch the repository.

326
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:36,210
Take the code from the Jenkins file and execute it.

327
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,070
Let's see if this.

328
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,630
And let's do the test now.

329
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,470
Showtime.

330
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:44,910
Click on Build Now.

331
00:17:46,730 --> 00:17:46,830
Okay.

332
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:47,930
It's going to take some time.

333
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:55,550
Let's click on this progress button here, symbol here, and we'll see what happens.

334
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:57,920
Okay.

335
00:17:58,190 --> 00:17:59,730
And that started working.

336
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,590
I guess first our code.

337
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,330
That means authentication is working.

338
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:08,910
And you see there it is installing there, Maven and JDK, you see that.

339
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,420
So the tools that we added it is installing that first.

340
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,880
Okay.

341
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:16,530
Running our MAVEN command.

342
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:18,780
Okay.

343
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,890
Okay, so there it failed.

344
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:26,980
It failed for a reason because it is not able to find these variables value.

345
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:31,750
And I thought of fixing this and showing it to you, you know.

346
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,000
But I thought, you know, you should see this error.

347
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,160
You see this variable, right?

348
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:36,490
It is.

349
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,140
There's there's no value to it.

350
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,270
So let's go to our VTS code.

351
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:43,740
And let's look at the variables.

352
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,110
Right?

353
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:49,420
It's snap, underscore, repo nexus, underscore, user nexus, underscore, pass.

354
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:50,380
It's all underscore there.

355
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,890
Right.

356
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:58,030
Let's go to settings dot XML and you see here we have hyphen nexus iPhone user nexus hyphen pass.

357
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:58,630
All right.

358
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:08,890
So you need to change all that hyphen to underscore so snap underscore repo nexus underscore user nexus

359
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,360
underscore pass.

360
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,420
I'm going to pause the video and do it.

361
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:14,740
Okay.

362
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,120
I've come to hear.

363
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:18,640
Everywhere.

364
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,230
Wherever you see invariable hyphen, just replace it with underscore save.

365
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,510
Let's go to pom dot xml.

366
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:26,920
Bombed out.

367
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
Also you have variable underscore.

368
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:36,210
Their nexus underscore.

369
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,400
Now, if you're thinking, why not just change the variable name?

370
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:42,910
Right.

371
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,200
But here it is.

372
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:51,280
Previously this hyphens were allowed, but now in Jenkins, the hyphen is an illegal character in Jenkins

373
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:51,550
file.

374
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:52,570
Pipeline code.

375
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,380
Right.

376
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:54,400
And this.

377
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:56,800
The hyphen is an illegal character.

378
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,260
So we replace it with underscore.

379
00:19:59,300 --> 00:19:59,800
Right.

380
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,420
Make sure you save this file.

381
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,690
Control less control less save.

382
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:09,460
Check it once again, I'm going to validate my screen and check once again.

383
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:10,010
Okay.

384
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:11,020
I think I'm good.

385
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,450
I'm going to say commit and push.

386
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,200
It's.

387
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,800
And we'll write a message replaced hyphens with underscore.

388
00:20:23,670 --> 00:20:24,120
Watching.

389
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,810
Mark.

390
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,370
See you.

391
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,030
Wait till it sinks.

392
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,670
Let's go to GitHub.

393
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,470
Sorry, Jenkins.

394
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:36,330
And let's test it once again.

395
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,260
Will Now.

396
00:20:41,860 --> 00:20:44,200
Okay, let's click on this loading bar.

397
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,560
Okay.

398
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,920
Things are working, you see.

399
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:51,990
It's downloading the dependencies from Nexus now.

400
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:52,560
See that?

401
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:55,950
And Nexus in turn is downloading from the MAVEN repository.

402
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:57,720
I'm going to pause my screen.

403
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,040
This is going to take some time.

404
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:01,620
All right.

405
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,680
It is a success.

406
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:03,630
Good job.

407
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:11,250
If it's not working for you, make sure you check the variable names properly once this is successful.

408
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,270
So what happened is downloaded the dependency from nexus.

409
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:20,160
Build the artifact, and it stored those dependencies in the Jenkins itself.

410
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,010
It creates a local repository.

411
00:21:23,010 --> 00:21:25,230
So when you click on build now once again.

412
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:29,550
So it will already have the dependencies.

413
00:21:29,570 --> 00:21:34,520
You see the next job, it's not going to download any dependency because it's already downloaded and

414
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,900
kept it in the jenkins.

415
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:36,730
Right.

416
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,210
If you go to Nexus.

417
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:41,440
I was logged out.

418
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:50,590
So login, go to browse section, click on this and go to browse and go to MAVEN Group repository.

419
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:54,790
See, these are all the dependencies it has stored it in the Nexus.

420
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,370
And it is coming actually from here.

421
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,040
It's stored here.

422
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,150
The problem even central.

423
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:00,800
See that?

424
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:04,560
So group will show all the repositories together.

425
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:06,350
Okay.

426
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:07,370
This is awesome.

427
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:09,380
But there's one problem.

428
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,540
Every time we commit, push our code.

429
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,400
We need to come here and click on build.

430
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,500
Now how about that is automated.

431
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:18,070
And actually that's how it is supposed to be.

432
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,860
Whenever you make a comment, the pipeline should trigger automatically.

433
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:25,070
That's what we will be seeing in the next lecture.

434
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:27,590
So wrap this up and join me in the next one.
