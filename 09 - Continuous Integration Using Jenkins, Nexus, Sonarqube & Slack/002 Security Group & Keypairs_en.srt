1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:00,900
Okay.

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:02,760
I have logged into my account.

3
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,090
I'm in North California region.

4
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:07,560
You can be in any region of your choice.

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,890
Let's go to keepers first and we'll create a key pair.

6
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:19,410
We'll just have one key to log into all our three instances and we will name it as we profile hyphen

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:20,700
see hyphen key.

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:26,940
I will keep it as PEM format because I will be using git bash or a terminal to log into my instance.

9
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:27,960
So PEM file.

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,590
If you plan to use putty then you can use PCA as well.

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,610
But let's keep it.

12
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:33,450
Pem create.

13
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,170
Keep it.

14
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:38,380
Saving it in the downloads directory.

15
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:42,460
Now let's create the security group for our 3c2 instance.

16
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,170
So let's go to security groups.

17
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:49,800
First, let's create for Jenkins Create Security Group.

18
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:54,060
Let's name it as Jenkins hyphen SG.

19
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,060
Add in inbound rule.

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,100
Now there are many people who make mistakes in and edit the outbound rules.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
Please do not do it.

22
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,330
Only in bound rule we will say.

23
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,790
Port 22 allowed from my IP so I can do a search.

24
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:20,900
And then we will see port 88 of the Jenkins allowed from any IPv4 and 8080.

25
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,550
Once again allowed from any IPV six.

26
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:34,290
Now generally I'll say it aloud from my IP, but we will be creating a GitHub webhook where GitHub will

27
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:37,350
be connecting to Jenkins from the internet.

28
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:40,430
So we are just saying it's allowed ADAT from anywhere.

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,700
So GitHub can connect to Jenkins on Port 88.

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,570
If we have to update a few more rules here, we'll come back in a moment.

31
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:55,110
Let's first create this security group ops description, give some description and let's see, create

32
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,010
security group.

33
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,730
Okay.

34
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,810
Next one will create for nexus.

35
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:03,110
So create security group will call it as.

36
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:12,080
Nexus g c in the description inbound rule 22 allowed from my IP.

37
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:19,970
Again so I can do search and port 8081 allowed from my IP.

38
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,050
Now nexus again is a web service will be listing on port 8081.

39
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:28,610
We access it from the browser and we will access nexus on port 88 one.

40
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,870
So I set my IP.

41
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,670
One more rule we have to give here.

42
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:35,860
Port 8081 from the Jenkins Security Group.

43
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,500
So just type SVG or you can just search for Jenkins.

44
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,890
You find your Jenkins security group and you add it.

45
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,240
Now this rule so Jenkins can upload artifact to the Nexus server.

46
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,620
And also it will be downloading dependency from the access server so that rule and see create security

47
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:56,190
group.

48
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:57,760
Okay.

49
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:02,330
Last security group sonar creates security group.

50
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:03,290
We'll call it as.

51
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,250
So on RSG.

52
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,060
Inbound rule.

53
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:14,390
Once again 22 from my IP so we can as such, we really don't need to do a search to sonar server in

54
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,230
this project.

55
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:17,210
But just in case, if you want to.

56
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,350
Now sonar cube service port number is 9000.

57
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,750
But we are setting up a Nexis service also in the sonar cube server, which will listen on Port 80.

58
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:32,130
So we'll see Port 80 allowed from my IP.

59
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,770
Also Port 80 allowed from the Jenkins Security Group.

60
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,070
So SG select Jenkins Security Group.

61
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:48,600
Now Jenkins will be uploading the test result to the cube server and it connects on the spot.

62
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,470
At least that's what we are going to configure.

63
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,630
Okay, let's create this.

64
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:56,470
Okay.

65
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:58,380
So all three security groups are created.

66
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:02,100
But there's one more entry we need to make in Jenkins Security Group.

67
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,290
In Bound Rule.

68
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,740
Edit This is the Jenkins Security Group.

69
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,460
Edit.

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:15,190
Now we said Jenkins will be connecting to smaller cube server, but sooner Cube Server will be also

71
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:19,300
sending a report or a result back to Jenkins.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,950
And within when it is connecting back to Jenkins, it will connect it on Port 88.

73
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,200
Now we can give this rule port 88.

74
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:29,210
And we can select Jenkins Security Group.

75
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:30,050
Oops.

76
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:30,620
Sorry.

77
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,610
Jenkins.

78
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,410
So on cube security group.

79
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:37,400
But anyways, port 88 is open for anywhere.

80
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:38,270
So.

81
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:41,810
So the cube server can connect to Jenkins on port 81.

82
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,510
Sorry, port 8080.

83
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:45,820
Then why I am adding this rule.

84
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:51,170
This is for your understanding if you have a restricted connection.

85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,330
Port 88 from my IP.

86
00:04:53,810 --> 00:04:58,300
In such case, if sonar wants to connect to Jenkins, then you need to add this rule.

87
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:01,220
Port 88 allowed from Sonar Security Group.

88
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,340
So let's see this.

89
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:11,740
Now, if you're not so good with a and security group and you just want to anyways do the project,

90
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:18,590
what you can do is in all the port numbers that I have given, just give it from anywhere port 22 from

91
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:19,160
anywhere.

92
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,720
Port 88 from anywhere.

93
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,490
Port 80, 81 from anywhere.

94
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:28,850
It's not good from a security point of view, but if you still want to continue with the project, then

95
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:29,810
you can do that.

96
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,200
One more thing.

97
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:38,860
If you take more than one day to complete this project and you have a broadband Internet connection,

98
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:44,130
which most of the people are using, so your public IP will change.

99
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:47,500
So you have given here in the rules.

100
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:52,450
Bought 22 allowed from my IP, but tomorrow your IP will be different.

101
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,060
So you need to come back to the security group.

102
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,490
You have to say 22 all out from my IP.

103
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,410
Wherever you have my IP, you just select and you just do it once again and you save it.

104
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:04,450
Also, you can just do a Google search.

105
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,740
What is my IP?

106
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:09,790
Find your public IP and you can add that IP also here.

107
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:13,210
All right.

108
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,000
So if you need a grasp of the understanding or you need to grasp what I suggest I did once again, rewind

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:26,620
the video, watch it once again, and make sure you get or understand all these rules and then wrap

110
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,330
this up and join me in the next lecture.
