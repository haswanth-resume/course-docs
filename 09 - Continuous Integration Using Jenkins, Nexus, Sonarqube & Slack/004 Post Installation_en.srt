1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,020
Okay.

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:02,420
So now let's.

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,190
To the post installation steps, starting with Jenkins.

4
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:10,420
Let's first search to the Jenkins, so copy its public IP.

5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,820
Open gate bash.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:16,480
For MapQuest, just use open terminal.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:20,840
Mention your key we profile.

8
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:22,920
Username is ubuntu.

9
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,120
So Ubuntu instance and paste the public ip.

10
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,190
Say yes.

11
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:39,050
Before I continue the step, I want you to note down this important point for the search, which will

12
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,560
be used in Jenkins to GitHub integration.

13
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,400
I'm talking here about search.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,880
Whenever you do a search for the first time to any server.

15
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,330
So I did search to this machine and that's the Jenkins public IP.

16
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:53,990
Yes.

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,520
That you will ask me a question.

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,500
This is the fingerprint.

19
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:01,400
Like an ID card of this search server.

20
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,570
Do you accept it?

21
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,530
And we said here.

22
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:04,340
Yes.

23
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,190
And then it stores this identity.

24
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,170
Into your home directory.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,050
Next time when you do the search.

26
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,490
So let's clear.

27
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,690
Let's log out.

28
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,910
And let's do a search once again.

29
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,880
This time it will not ask me the question.

30
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,690
See that directly logged in.

31
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,870
Now this process is called us host key checking and it has nothing to do with Jenkins or anything I'm

32
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,680
talking about here.

33
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,450
Purely about search.

34
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:39,440
We'll have a step where Jenkins will do a search to your GitHub account to access your repository.

35
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,420
That time we need to do this step from Jenkins user.

36
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:44,810
Okay.

37
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,620
Anyways, we logged in.

38
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:46,520
Let's do pseudo hyphen.

39
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,380
I clear the screen.

40
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:52,520
Let's check the service system CTL status jenkins.

41
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,660
It should be in a running state queue to quit from this.

42
00:01:57,710 --> 00:01:59,420
Now let's access it from the browser.

43
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,340
Now let's copy its public IP.

44
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,060
Paste it.

45
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,850
Colon 8080.

46
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,370
That's the port number for Jenkins 88.

47
00:02:10,310 --> 00:02:10,550
Okay.

48
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:11,390
This thing unlocked.

49
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:19,190
Jenkins So this is the file which will have the initial password, copy its path, go to the Jenkins

50
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:22,670
Sicat and paste that pot under the tongue.

51
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:23,150
Twister.

52
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:24,920
Paste that part.

53
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:25,410
Okay.

54
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,840
You get the password.

55
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,800
Copy that.

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,360
Be stood there.

57
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,020
Administrator.

58
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:31,590
Password.

59
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,430
Continue.

60
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:37,280
Click on install suggested plugins.

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,100
It will take some time.

62
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,370
I'll pause the video.

63
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,200
This is done.

64
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,460
Let's set a username.

65
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,300
I'll just set a username as admin and I'll set a password.

66
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:52,840
Not to give a full name.

67
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:54,790
I'll just say admin with a capital.

68
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,620
Let's give an email address.

69
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,660
Just give a fake email address.

70
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:01,970
Okay.

71
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,490
That is the Jenkins you are is going to store in the Jenkins configuration because it gets it from its

72
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:12,780
IP currently, whatever it is let's see when finish.

73
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:15,730
Start using Jenkins.

74
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:19,140
Okay.

75
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,200
We need to install some plug ins in Jenkins, so we'll go to manage Jenkins.

76
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,070
Manage plugins.

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,820
If you don't know what a Jenkins plugin is, these are just extra features which you can install.

78
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,740
Like, for example, we will be using Nexus Owner Cube, so we will install those plugins.

79
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,690
So go to available.

80
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:44,930
And search for the plugins.

81
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:49,640
So these are the names starting with Maven integration.

82
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,670
Put a checkmark.

83
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,390
Just put a checkmark for now.

84
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,870
Next is GitHub integration.

85
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,670
Put a checkmark.

86
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:03,680
Now we have a maven build, so we're using Maven integration plugin.

87
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,880
GitHub will integrate Jenkins with GitHub.

88
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,620
So GitHub integration plugin.

89
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,160
Nexus.

90
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:15,090
Nexus artifact uploader put a checkmark.

91
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:17,660
Sooner.

92
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,269
So on our cube scanner.

93
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
On our cube scanner there.

94
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:24,390
Slack.

95
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,410
We will be using Slack for the notification.

96
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,270
So search for slack and you see Slack notification check mark.

97
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,750
And for versioning our artifact, our software will be using a plugin called Timestamp.

98
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,340
It's actually called us build timestamp with the checkmark there.

99
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,760
This gives us this variable build underscore timestamp which will have the current timestamp which we

100
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,740
can use to version our artifact.

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,210
Okay.

102
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,480
These are good for now.

103
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:59,690
Make sure you type the correct plugin name.

104
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:02,480
It is not as good such as Google search.

105
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:06,980
So the names of the plugin should be exactly what you are looking for.

106
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,990
Put a checkmark on all of that and say install without restart.

107
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:12,910
Okay.

108
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,770
Scroll till the end and see if everything is success.

109
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:16,540
We are good.

110
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,640
Click back on Dashboard.

111
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:20,750
Okay.

112
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,630
This is good for now.

113
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,430
And Jenkins, we have many more things in Jenkins that will be seen in later lectures.

114
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,080
Let's check Nexus now.

115
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,560
So let's click on Nexus, get its public IP.

116
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,120
Let's do an SSH to it.

117
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:36,290
So we log out from Jenkins here.

118
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,850
Easy to hyphen user.

119
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:46,810
We have used Amazon Linux too.

120
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:48,900
The user name is easy to hyphen user.

121
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,340
It's public IP.

122
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,330
So, yes.

123
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:57,420
I got to do a pseudo hyphen, I.

124
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:02,440
System CTL status nexus.

125
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:04,340
Okay.

126
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,320
The service is active.

127
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,800
Let's look at it from the browser.

128
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:11,540
Portis at 81.

129
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,810
Make sure you copy the correct public IP of Nexis.

130
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:18,800
Let's click on sign in here.

131
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:24,290
And it is saying the initial password is in this file, so let's copy this file part.

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,880
And let's go to the Nexus.

133
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:31,660
Yeah.

134
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:32,730
That's the password.

135
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:37,960
I mean, it just doesn't give the new line, so we need to copy it properly.

136
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:41,450
Make sure you don't copy that square bracket.

137
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,530
Just copy this.

138
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:48,200
So the username is Edwin and the password that we just copied.

139
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,020
Sign in.

140
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:50,590
Okay.

141
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:51,460
The setup wizard.

142
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,210
Next.

143
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,100
Okay.

144
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,850
Let's give a password.

145
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,820
Make sure you remember all these passports that you're giving or write it somewhere.

146
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:05,970
And here we say disable anonymous access.

147
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:11,280
We don't want anybody to download or upload artifact to our access server only with authentication,

148
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,930
with username and password.

149
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,500
So we'll say disable anonymous access next.

150
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,560
And finish.

151
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:21,430
Okay.

152
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,620
So we have two major section here in the Nexus.

153
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:28,090
This is to browse the repository or upload the artifact to the repository.

154
00:07:28,090 --> 00:07:32,350
And this section is for the administration configurations.

155
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:37,840
So if you remember from the architectural diagram, we are going to upload the artifact to access and

156
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:40,450
also download dependencies from Nexus.

157
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:46,600
So we'll have multiple repositories and we will club all the repositories together in a group repository

158
00:07:46,810 --> 00:07:49,060
we will be creating here for repository.

159
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:50,890
So click on repositories here.

160
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,090
And they create repository.

161
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,630
Maven.

162
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,580
Come here.

163
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,930
Maven hosted will select first.

164
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:03,490
And we will give it a name.

165
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,080
We profile.

166
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,180
Hyphen release.

167
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:15,050
Now you can't really give any name, but you need to make sure you mention that name in the Maven configuration

168
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,390
to keep things simple.

169
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,010
Just give the same name as I am giving.

170
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:22,820
So we prefer release repositories to store our artifact.

171
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,900
We'll upload our tested artifact to Nexus in this repository.

172
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,740
So let's give the name and come down and say, Create repository.

173
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,309
The next repository will be creating create a repository.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,820
And this will be maven to proxy.

175
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:40,990
Proxy.

176
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,100
Click on that.

177
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:47,660
Now the purpose of this repository is to store the dependencies.

178
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:54,740
Our maven tool in Jenkins will download dependencies maven dependencies from this repository.

179
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,770
This is called this proxy repository for Maven.

180
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:07,010
I will give the name here, the pro maven central, and come down here in proxy remote storage.

181
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:13,460
Now, Maven will download dependency from this repository, but from where the nexus will download the

182
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,560
dependencies.

183
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:18,740
So maybe when we ask for a dependency it does not have in this proxy repository.

184
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:23,810
So it will download it from a you are a maven repository, which is this one.

185
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,920
You can check this URL from the browser.

186
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,410
You will see all the maven dependencies over there.

187
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:34,630
So if Nexus needs the dependencies to store, it is going to download it from this repository.

188
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:35,530
Okay.

189
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:38,470
Let's come down and just create a repository.

190
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:40,720
Okay.

191
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,090
One more repository.

192
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,360
This will be also maven hosted.

193
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:54,790
Its name is Snapshot and you need to change the policy from release to Snapshot.

194
00:09:55,510 --> 00:10:00,640
We are really not going to use this repository, but in your project, if you have snapshot repository

195
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
concept, this is how you create it.

196
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:07,990
A snapshot artifact will have at the end hyphen snapshot an extension.

197
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:14,230
If you know what I'm saying, you will be able to integrate, if not just create the repository.

198
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,070
What is it?

199
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,330
Create a repository.

200
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,580
Okay.

201
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:22,020
The last one is going to be the group repository.

202
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,910
And this is going to be maven to group.

203
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,640
This is simply to group all the repositories together.

204
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,640
And this is the name I'm giving here.

205
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,410
It's a group repository.

206
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,550
You need to add the repositories that we created previously.

207
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:41,730
So click on Maven Central and this arrow.

208
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,740
The Profile release.

209
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,410
Click on that, the profile snapshot.

210
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,460
Click on that.

211
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:49,810
Yeah.

212
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,140
That's the whole purpose of this repository to group them together.

213
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:54,830
Create.

214
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:56,040
Okay.

215
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,090
Once again, we created for repository, we profile release, we profile snapshot v pro maven central

216
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:05,070
and V Pro Maven Group.

217
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:09,960
We grouped all these three repositories into repro maven group repository.

218
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,050
That is all the setup that you need to do on Nexis.

219
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:13,830
Okay.

220
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,980
We have one final thing to validate, which is Stoner Cube.

221
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:26,180
Now, if everything went fine, just copy its IP and paste it in the browser, the public IP and you

222
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:26,900
should see.

223
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:32,630
So the cube login page, you don't need to really do a search, but if you want to search and validate

224
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,370
the service, it's just the service name is Soner System CTL status soner.

225
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:41,030
The username is admin and the password is admin.

226
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,470
In the real time.

227
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:48,670
I really, highly, highly recommend to change the password.

228
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,370
Do not use default passwords.

229
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,080
Okay.

230
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,490
So that is all.

231
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:56,490
We verified all three services.

232
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,360
We did the post installation steps.

233
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:01,980
So wrap this up and join me in the next lecture.
