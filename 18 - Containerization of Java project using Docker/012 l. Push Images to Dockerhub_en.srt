1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,890
So once you've performed all your tests and you feel now your containers are right, then you can finally

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,530
push your images to Docker Hub.

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,900
So let's go to.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,240
Oh, sure.

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:15,610
Okay.

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:17,300
I have to close this control.

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,780
See if I do control C, all the containers will be stopped.

8
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:22,730
But we'll bring it up again.

9
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:24,650
We'll run it in the background.

10
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:32,119
So we have to say Docker compose hyphen up, hyphen, hyphen d, So it's going to be running in background.

11
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:34,370
Then we will not be seeing the logs.

12
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:41,060
If you wish to see log of any container, you can just say Docker logs and you can give a container

13
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,420
name like compose a pro DB.

14
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,070
So it should show you all the logs.

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:50,990
So that's fine.

16
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,800
Now it's time to push our image to Docker Hub.

17
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:56,860
So we are going to do Docker login.

18
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,750
If you're using Docker Hub, you just need to say Docker login.

19
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:02,060
By default, it will go to Docker Hub.

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,080
So I'm going to give my account name.

21
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,260
And password.

22
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,660
And it says Login succeeded.

23
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,240
I have logged in and it's very easy to push.

24
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,220
I'm just going to say Docker push.

25
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,010
Let's push our app image first.

26
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:27,760
Colon tag we have to mention because there's no latest.

27
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,850
So it's pushing it on Docker Hub now.

28
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,600
That one image goes up on Docker Hub.

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,770
Lets push push the other image web.

30
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,390
And one more.

31
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:51,400
DB.

32
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:54,820
Okay.

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:56,140
The third image also.

34
00:01:56,470 --> 00:01:58,480
Now let's go to Docker Hub.

35
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,510
Our repositories.

36
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:06,910
Okay, so let's see.

37
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,650
DB.

38
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:12,930
Okay, so there's a V1 tag.

39
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,850
And you can anytime, say, Docker pool.

40
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,500
It's a public repository, so anybody in the world can say Dr. Poole and the image name and pull it.

41
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,160
See the tags there.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,290
Bills.

43
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:36,210
So if you want, you can have your Docker half file on your GitHub or Bitbucket and you can link it

44
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:42,720
with Docker Hub and it can for every comment, it will fetch your image, fetch all your Docker, have

45
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,280
file and build the image.

46
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,600
It can do that for you.
