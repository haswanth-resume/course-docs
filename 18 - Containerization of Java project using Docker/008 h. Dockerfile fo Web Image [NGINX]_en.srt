1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,460
For engine X.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,660
Directory web.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,650
Create a docker file in this.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,120
So we can see from engineers any version is fine.

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,070
Default is fine.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,020
So it's going to fetch the default image.

7
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,080
Let's also give some label.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,780
I will give project.

9
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:33,680
Equal to.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:35,960
The profile.

11
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,840
Q Also, one more.

12
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:44,720
Author.

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,940
And I'll give my name.

14
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:58,480
And if you can also use this label for our other Docker files, let's put that DB or here as well.

15
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:12,590
Okay, so the engine X image that we're going to use from the Docker hub, we need to change configuration

16
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:13,250
in that.

17
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,120
So that's an image we can use the latest version.

18
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:23,410
Let's see.

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,450
Where does it hold the configuration?

20
00:01:27,230 --> 00:01:29,480
That's engine X main configuration file.

21
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,780
We have some variables we can use.

22
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,510
Our own configuration can be pushed in this location quarter D so we can have multiple configuration

23
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,470
in that directory.

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,300
So we can put it in the templates directory inside that and that will send it the configuration over

25
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,910
here, the output or here.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,020
So this is the default configuration file.

27
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,480
If you want, we can erase this or we can put it in the templates directory in the config config file,

28
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,550
which will automatically replace this.

29
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:09,139
We will remove this configuration file, default one, and then we'll put our own configuration file

30
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:09,710
in that.

31
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:17,820
So changes to Tron Command and I see atom hyphen RF.

32
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:27,720
And remove that configuration file, which is the default one, and copy our configuration file caps.

33
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:34,530
So we'll build our own configuration file with this name and we're going to place it.

34
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,500
And dislocation.

35
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:45,130
With name for pro app dot conf.

36
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,330
So that becomes our default application.

37
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,530
We'll also have to create this file, so let's copy this name and the same location.

38
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,680
Okay, So that should be the configuration.

39
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:09,670
It's going to listen on Port 80 and it's going to forward the request to a container named Pro App on

40
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:10,540
Port 88.

41
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:17,380
So based on this configuration, we have to understand the container that we're going to run with.

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,720
Our application has to be of this name.

43
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,070
We have to run the container with this name in a Docker environment.

44
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,940
In a Kubernetes environment, we have to run service with this name.

45
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:30,190
And also we have to be careful.

46
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,570
We run it on this port.

47
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:39,210
Okay, let's see if all these files and we're going to not commit them.

48
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,340
Before we build and test it.
