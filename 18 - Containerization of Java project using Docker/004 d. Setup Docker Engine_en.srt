1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Okay, I'm in my system.

2
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,030
I have opened gate bash and I'm going to launch a virtual machine with Vagrant.

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:13,120
We're going to build, run and test our Docker images and containers in this virtual machine.

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:19,450
If you wish to run it on easy to instance on us or if you have any other platform that you're using,

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,740
you can go with that.

6
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,660
We just need an open to operating system where we can run our Docker commands.

7
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:30,430
So I will create a directory Docker hyphen engine.

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,480
I'll get into that.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:42,100
I'll see if I grant in it or one two slash bionic 64.

10
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,830
So that's 1 to 18 operating system.

11
00:00:45,490 --> 00:00:46,820
So it created a vagrant file.

12
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:55,660
I am also going to give it an IP address so I can access from my browser also when I'm making a test.

13
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:59,350
Oh, you can also use the APIs offered.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,730
So let's give some IP.

15
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:04,310
I'll give 33.12.

16
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:07,230
That should be fine.

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,610
Make sure that IP does not conflict with your network.

18
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:16,700
If you wish to give extra RAM size, you can do that, but this should be fine for now.

19
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:19,760
Let's see if I get it up.

20
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,460
KVM sop let me log into it.

21
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:27,080
First thing I'm going to do is I'm going to install docker engine on that.

22
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,390
Let me clear the screen.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,510
Okay, let's go to Docker documentation.

24
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:36,290
Docs dot docker dot com.

25
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:39,040
First we have download and install.

26
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,550
Let's install it for we're looking for Docker for Linux.

27
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:45,620
Specifically you want to.

28
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:53,900
If you're using an existing Docker engine, you can remove the older versions of Docker engine.

29
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,020
So I'm going to go through the steps.

30
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,970
First Running App update.

31
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,890
Installing some dependencies.

32
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:12,940
Setting up a stable repositories from where our Docker engine can be installed.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,720
A GPG key error.

34
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,870
Let's add the GPG key.

35
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,860
And let's run the command again.

36
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,680
That is done now.

37
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:46,430
Time to install Docker engine.

38
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:53,450
We don't need to run app update because our ad app Repository Command already updated the repository,

39
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:57,740
but still, let's do it for the sake of documentation.

40
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,330
And then let's install Docker engine.

41
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,630
We should have no docker installed.

42
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,200
Let's check the Docker version.

43
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:22,250
So I have 1903 13 version currently.

44
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,290
This should be fine.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,660
I want the Ubuntu user or the current user normal user.

46
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:36,360
I have a current user to run Docker command which will not be possible by default.

47
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:37,820
Get permission denied.

48
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,720
So we need to add.

49
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,820
Vagrant user into docker group.

50
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,850
Pseudo user mod.

51
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,240
Hyphen e.

52
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,960
Hyphen Capital G.

53
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,290
Group name Docker and the user name Vagrant.

54
00:03:59,190 --> 00:03:59,850
That should be done.

55
00:03:59,850 --> 00:04:02,910
You can exit and log in again.

56
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:06,940
Or we can say source Bashar see file also.

57
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:22,470
Jay So vagrant user is part of Docker group and we can run now Docker commands, which is good.

58
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,790
So the Docker engine is definitely running.

59
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:28,430
We are able to run the Docker command.
