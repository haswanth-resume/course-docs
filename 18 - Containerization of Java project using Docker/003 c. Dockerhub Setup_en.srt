1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:04,840
Okay, so since we made our decisions on what images to build.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,770
Once we build our images, we'll be hosting it on Docker Hub.

3
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:14,740
So if you don't have Docker Hub account still, then sign up, create an account on Docker Hub and log

4
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:16,100
in once you log in.

5
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,860
Get into organisations.

6
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:23,500
We're going to create an organization so we can collaboratively work together.

7
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,220
In our team.

8
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:27,310
So I will go with the free team.

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:28,230
Okay.

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:30,780
But, you know, this really is a good option.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,580
But it's, you know, we just want to practice on a project so free one should be fine.

12
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:39,620
So organization namespace.

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:42,980
So we'll say we profile.

14
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:45,900
Company name.

15
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:47,770
I'm going to give visual path.

16
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:53,350
And I will say create organization.

17
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:57,360
So what are the benefits of organization, really?

18
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,660
Well, one thing for sure is we can collaborate.

19
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,790
We can have for for the free account.

20
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,290
We can have three members.

21
00:01:05,349 --> 00:01:10,660
If you want more members to collaborate, we need to pay, but that should be fine for now.

22
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:17,170
We can have repositories named as the organization's name and not the account name.

23
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,110
You can also create teams, different teams over here.

24
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:23,630
Settings.

25
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:29,780
If you go linked accounts, you can link your GitHub or Bitbucket Bitbucket account with this.

26
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:32,690
Docker also provides you continuous integration.

27
00:01:32,690 --> 00:01:37,370
As soon as there is a commit, it can fetch your docker file and build the image for you.

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,470
So you don't need to set up your own continuous integration pipeline which will be convenient.

29
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:44,900
You can set default privacy.

30
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,570
So by default we have public.

31
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,590
But we can go private.

32
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:57,190
But then we need multiple private repositories and we don't have because we are on a free account.

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:02,330
We have notification as well.

34
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:09,620
We can send notification of build failures on email or on Slack, and that should be convenient.

35
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,050
So this is good.

36
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,630
I have created an organization.

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,850
You also create an organization with whatever name you prefer.
