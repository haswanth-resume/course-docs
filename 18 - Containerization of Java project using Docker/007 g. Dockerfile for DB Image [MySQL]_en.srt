1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,910
So we'll create one more directory in this.

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,980
Named DB.

3
00:00:07,689 --> 00:00:10,060
And we'll write another Docker file in this.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
For this will be using my skull.

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:32,800
My skull tag 5.6 or 5.7 we can use.

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,660
Not eight.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,060
It doesn't work with their application.

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,360
So we can go with 5.7 or we can also go with five or six.

9
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,290
We have to set the usernames and passwords.

10
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:48,590
So we can do it through environment variables.

11
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:50,270
My SQL root Password.

12
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,740
My SQL database.

13
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:58,580
And my SQL user, if you want to set up any other user, will be using the root user and we'll set a

14
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,250
password for this by setting value to this variable.

15
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,080
And we'll also initialize it with our SQL file.

16
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,820
So we'll be putting our SQL file in this location so we can use add or copy command to do that.

17
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:16,730
Let's build the Docker file from.

18
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,080
My SQL.

19
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,180
I'm using the tag 5.7.25, which is.

20
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,300
Relevant with our V profile application.

21
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,480
Ian, we.

22
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:38,170
My SQL root password and I'm going to save a pro DB pass.

23
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,870
One more database so it can create a database named as accounts.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:55,450
And we can use add or copy command to copy your SQL file in that.

25
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:59,050
So we will copy the SQL file from our source code.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,430
So SQL file is DB underscore backup SQL.

27
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,229
And as per documentation, we have to push it in this location.

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:13,120
Okay, let's copy this SQL file in this directory.

29
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,610
So if you have in the source code.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,670
Mean.

31
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:20,720
Resources.

32
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,760
That's the file.

33
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,990
So let's copy it.

34
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:29,260
And this location.

35
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:40,850
Yeah, it's there.

36
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:48,770
So when we have it in this place, when we say Doctor Bill is going to copy this SQL file into our container.

37
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,170
Okay, one more.
