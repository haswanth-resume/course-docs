1
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:03,830
You can clone the source code.

2
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,120
V Profile Project Source Code.

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,000
So I'm going to clone the source code.

4
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:17,030
If you have it already cloned, just get into the repository and do get pull so you get the latest changes.

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:20,460
Let's see if you already have it.

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,320
Just do a good poll inside that.

7
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:24,060
So get all the latest changes.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:24,950
We are already up to date.

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,950
We just cloned it.

10
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,550
We are going to use a branch Kubernetes.

11
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,600
Hyphen setup up.

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,060
So you have different directories over here.

13
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:40,890
First, we're going to do Mini Cube, so let's get into mini Cube.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,200
And that is a simple piece of document.

15
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:49,620
First, you need to install chocolatey from prerequisite video.

16
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:54,130
You should already have chocolatey on your system if you don't have run this command and have chocolate

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:54,880
installed.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,220
Once you have chocolate install from PowerShell, close the PowerShell open up again.

19
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,000
Open PowerShell with administrator.

20
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,110
We will copy this command to set up chocolaty.

21
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:38,390
In case if you're getting error over here, like restricted or not allowed, then turn off your antivirus

22
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:39,880
for a moment and run this command.

23
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:42,980
You should have the latest version of chocolaty on your system.

24
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,430
Once you have done this, close PowerShell.

25
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,170
And start again with admin privilege.

26
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,699
Next, we're going to run this command Choko install mini cube, which will install the mini cube to

27
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:16,630
your tool and Kubernetes hyphen cli, which is the command line tool to connect to the Kubernetes cluster.

28
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:46,870
Okay, Now I have latest version of Mini Cube and Kubernetes.

29
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:48,960
See a light tool.

30
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:55,580
I can close this now and I can use my GED bash, which is much more convenient.

31
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:57,940
Jack.

32
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,810
Mini Cube.

33
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,440
Hyphen hyphen help.

34
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:08,760
If you still don't see me in command, then close.

35
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,540
Get back and start again.

36
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:17,250
So we are going to say Mini Cube start, which is going to start a local cooper in this cluster and

37
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:18,900
then we'll check its status.

38
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:22,500
So many cube start.

39
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,990
It's going to take some time because it's going to download an image and then bring up a VM on Oracle

40
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:32,610
VM VirtualBox.

41
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:44,720
It is done.

42
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,540
The Cuban is cluster is up.

43
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:48,340
You can see a VM.

44
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:55,160
So you can check Mini cube Cube CTL get nodes.

45
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,050
And you should see your one node, which is master node.

46
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:10,010
So Kube CTL, which we installed through chocolaty, is using a file which is in your home directory.

47
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:14,520
Dot cube configured this part cube config file.

48
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,170
So that's the cube config file.

49
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,120
You have the cluster detail over here.

50
00:04:18,149 --> 00:04:21,870
Cube config file is used by the Cube CTL command.

51
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,530
So the server detail, the name of the cluster.

52
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:26,910
This is the cluster detail.

53
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:28,990
Down here.

54
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:30,310
You have users.

55
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:36,300
Meaning you and client cert client key for the user and then context.

56
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,210
Context marries the user with the cluster.

57
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:44,790
So you say in context cluster the name of the cluster mini cube, which is this one.

58
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
User, McHugh.

59
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:50,490
So that's the mini cube user.

60
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,900
With the credentials to login.

61
00:04:54,590 --> 00:05:02,600
So when I see Cube CTL get nodes, it is using that cube config file to access our cluster.

62
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,550
Now let's run a few more tests.

63
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:07,520
So let's go to Kubernetes documentation.

64
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,240
Learning environment.

65
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,040
Meaning you.

66
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:15,990
All right.

67
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:18,570
So we just did this mini cube cluster is up.

68
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,570
And now we can test by running cubes.

69
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,010
It'll create deployment.

70
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,860
So this command created a deployment named Halo Mini Cube.

71
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:41,010
It has fetch and image from Google Container, Registry Cube, CTL, Get Pod, and you should see a

72
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,590
pod running from the deployment cube.

73
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,210
It'll get deploy.

74
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:49,180
So this deploy is running this pod.

75
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,620
Okay, let's expose it so it creates a service which we can then access.

76
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:07,860
It'll expose deployment, deployment, name, hyphen, hyphen type, node port on port 88 to check the

77
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,430
URL of our deployment of our service.

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,570
Run this command and you should get a URL so we can access.

79
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,450
Our application at this URL.

80
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,750
And you should get this and that.

81
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,170
Just test that your mini cube cluster is up and running.

82
00:06:31,170 --> 00:06:35,160
You're able to create pod deployment and expose service for it.

83
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:40,110
So in our next project, we are going to host a Java application on Kubernetes cluster.

84
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,350
In this project, we are just seeing the setup by using different different tools.

85
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,590
So one mini cube is done.

86
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,860
Now let's wrap it up.

87
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:58,100
Q Ctrl get CVC will force delete our service.

88
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,020
Q It'll delete.

89
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,980
C.

90
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,160
That's a service.

91
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:08,030
Q It'll get deploy.

92
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,270
Q It'll delete.

93
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:12,320
Deploy.

94
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:14,940
Hello, Hyphen Mini.

95
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,920
Q So delete the deployment and it's going to delete your pod as well.

96
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,890
Now let's stop the mini cube cluster.

97
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:24,790
Mini cube.

98
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,540
Stop.

99
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,570
And then finally you can say mini cube delete.

100
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:36,430
And you should have not.

101
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:38,280
No VM over here.

102
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,300
So that's good.

103
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,140
Hansen.

104
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,540
On a Kubernetes cluster.
