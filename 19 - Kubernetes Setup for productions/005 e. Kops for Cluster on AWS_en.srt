1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,640
To set up Kubernetes cluster with cars.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:03,540
We need to have.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,430
We need to do some prerequisites.

4
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:10,080
The first, you need to have a domain where we're going to use.

5
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,840
Use it for Cuba and its DNS records.

6
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,220
So like I have a domain from GoDaddy groovy dot in.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,520
So you should also have if you gone through the prerequisites video.

8
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,980
We need a Linux VM we can use with current VM, but I'm going to use EC2 instance.

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,750
If you wish to use your current VM, you can do that.

10
00:00:33,020 --> 00:00:35,810
This VM will be only to set up the cops.

11
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,980
Kube Ctl ssh keys and a clean.

12
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:44,560
So this will be our base machine to launch the Kubernetes cluster with cops.

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:48,070
This will be not part of the code in this cluster and this VM.

14
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:53,590
We are going to install COPS Cube CTL, which is going to generate SSH keys and we're going to install

15
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:56,590
a, w, C, and also a configurable clean.

16
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:59,050
You us account.

17
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,510
We need an S3 bucket and I am user for a CLI.

18
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:08,950
We're going to need route 53 hosted zone which will be our subdomain.

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,410
So after creating the hostage zone, we are going to give its entry.

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,370
We'll get the NSS servers, name server URLs.

21
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:19,910
We're going to give it's entry in our domain.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,160
I'm going to use GoDaddy and I'm going to create for DNS records and record, which is going to point

23
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:32,280
out to a subdomain to name server from eight plus Route 53.

24
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:37,110
So domain on GoDaddy, subdomain on Amazon Route 53.

25
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:40,610
Okay, so let's do the prerequisites first.

26
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,570
I'm on my management console, I'm on EC2 service.

27
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:49,580
I'm going to launch an easy to instance.

28
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:54,910
And I'm going to use Ubuntu Server 20.

29
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,610
T2 Micro should be fine.

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:02,230
Our default.

31
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:05,920
This is for our cops setup.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,540
I'm going to name it as a cops.

33
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,590
Just cops.

34
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,680
We need a simple security group for this.

35
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:17,710
We're just going to do a search to it.

36
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:23,200
Support 22 allowed from my IP.

37
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:27,280
And will create a key.

38
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:29,360
Mm.

39
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,860
Cops key.

40
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:36,800
Let's launch the instance.

41
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:42,800
By the time this is getting launched, let's do some other things on that.

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:48,080
We need like an S3 bucket and we also need to create an IAM user.

43
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,150
And also Route 53 hosted zone.

44
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,730
So let's go to S3 bucket.

45
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:55,940
Let's create a bucket.

46
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,290
This bucket going is going to store the state of cops.

47
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:04,430
So we're going to maintain the cops state in an S3 bucket.

48
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:09,800
And if you do that, then we can run our COPS command from anywhere as long as we pointed to our S3

49
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,390
bucket.

50
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,040
So let's name it as v profile hyphen cops hyphen state.

51
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,020
And I'm going to say create.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,630
Okay.

53
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:27,370
If you have a bucket now, let's create an I am user.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,980
This will be for a CLI.

55
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,230
I'm going to name this user as cops admin Programatic access.

56
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:43,980
I'm going to give it administrator access because it's going to access various service like VPC.

57
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,940
It's going to create auto scaling group Route 53.

58
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:53,360
If you want, we can selectively select all those permission, even S3 bucket, and we can give that

59
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,400
or we can just give administrator access.

60
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,730
But then we have to be very careful with the access keys.

61
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,490
I'm going to download the credentials.

62
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,270
Okay, Now let's go to Amazon Route 53.

63
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,030
We're going to create a hosted zone.

64
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:19,640
Mm.

65
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,350
V profile.

66
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:24,110
Now.

67
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,370
I should see Cube.

68
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,580
Repro.

69
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:31,560
Okay.

70
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,490
That is going to be my subdomain.

71
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:37,810
It's going to be a publicly hosted zone create hosted zone.

72
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:40,090
Oh, of course.

73
00:04:40,090 --> 00:04:42,640
I have to give the complete domain name.

74
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,000
Also graphy dot n so my domain is graphy dot n.

75
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,520
So I'm saying q v dot groovy dot in.

76
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,910
And I'm going to create a hostage zone now.

77
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,800
So close that terror.

78
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:56,340
Okay.

79
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,850
When we do that, we should get the server's URL.

80
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,360
And we can add this entry in our domain.

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,260
Registrar.

82
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:06,570
I'm going to do that in my GoDaddy account.

83
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,420
So log into your registrar provider.

84
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,390
I'm on my GoDaddy account and I'm going to add four names.

85
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,040
Record name, server, host.

86
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,740
Said all students own name Q Vpro.

87
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,530
Points to the NZT server.

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,180
So we have for any server.

89
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm going to take that one first.

90
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,020
Save it like that.

91
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll add entry for the other three.

92
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,000
And that should be it.

93
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:53,540
I have four new records over here for my sub domain that points to the name server of Amazon Route 53.

94
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:56,910
Okay, we're done here.

95
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,780
Okay, so now we have a user and a three bucket.

96
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,610
That's our three bucket.

97
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,550
And easy to instance.

98
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:11,820
Now we'll log into our receipt instance and we'll set up everything.

99
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:38,790
So first I will generate the SSH key, which will be used by the cops.

100
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,820
So the public key will be pushed to all our instances.

101
00:06:45,230 --> 00:06:47,550
You just generate the key, that's all.

102
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
Next we will install a CLI.

103
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:54,280
So I'm going to run first apt update

104
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,340
apt install a c ally.

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:12,650
After having my IWC lie, I'm going to configure it as configure.

106
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:18,170
It's going to ask the access key and secret key, which I already have downloaded.

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,130
Region.

108
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,990
We are using a higher region.

109
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:46,870
So the code is us east to.

110
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:51,950
Output.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,810
I would like to have it in JSON format if I need to.

112
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:57,870
S c l i configured now.

113
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,780
We need Kube, ctl and cops.

114
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:05,630
So from the company's documentation, install and set up Cube CTL.

115
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:08,060
You can just copy this command.

116
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,360
Which will download Cube Ctrl.

117
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,400
So we should have now a little binary.

118
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:27,050
We are going to give it executable permission and then we're going to move it to use our local bin.

119
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,700
So if you move it over there, then we can access it from anywhere.

120
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:33,140
Cube, CTL.

121
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,610
Hyphen hyphen vision.

122
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:41,070
I don't think there is a version, but there is hyphen hyphen help.

123
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,560
Yes.

124
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,840
And still is installed.

125
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,880
Now final tool to install is the cops.

126
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,870
Installing cooperatives with cops.

127
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,060
Linux.

128
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,200
You copy that command?

129
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:07,600
That should download as a cop's binary.

130
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,370
Okay, that's there.

131
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,820
Let's give it to executable permission.

132
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,200
And that's off of your name, so I'm going to move it.

133
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:34,570
To use our local bin with name cops.

134
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
Let's check it.

135
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,120
Cops hyphen hyphen help.

136
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:48,390
And copse is also set because now we can run, the cops come on and create our cluster.

137
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,880
But before that I would like to verify my domain.

138
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,470
So I will do an s lookup hyphen type.

139
00:09:59,110 --> 00:10:07,270
Nice and my domain cube with pro dot graphy dot in.

140
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:12,670
And yeah, that results to the for name server.

141
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:13,390
Okay.

142
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:17,950
Now I'm going to run a cops command which will create the queries cluster.

143
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:21,250
And this is a little longer command.

144
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,590
So let's try and understand it.

145
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:27,910
The same time command is cops create cluster.

146
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,280
That's the command and we need to pass a lot of arguments.

147
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:36,190
First is the name of our cluster, which will give the same as our domain.

148
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,220
So I type that and you type your domain.

149
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:47,050
I'm going to say space a backward slash and hit enter so I can keep entering the command in the next

150
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:47,650
line.

151
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:51,980
Next I'm going to say hyphen hyphen state.

152
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:55,710
Equal to s three colon, slash slash.

153
00:10:56,980 --> 00:11:02,050
The bucket name which we created in the prerequisites then hyphen hyphen zones.

154
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:04,230
Equal to.

155
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:07,040
US is to a comma.

156
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:10,340
US is to be two zones.

157
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:13,630
So I'm going to mention two worker nodes.

158
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,390
These two worker nodes will be distributed in these two zones.

159
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:25,720
So space backward slash eight enter hyphen hyphen node hyphen count equal to two.

160
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,920
If you wish, you can give more than that.

161
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,930
But for the practice purpose, it should be fine.

162
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,000
And then it's.

163
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,050
Then it's size, hyphen, hyphen, node, hyphen size.

164
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,490
Is equal to TW three dot small.

165
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,210
Yes.

166
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,450
This is not going to be free.

167
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:48,750
It is not going to be t three micro.

168
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,170
You can try with t three micro.

169
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,690
It works.

170
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,060
But when we run our workloads, when we run our parts containers, then it will become slow and even

171
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:57,650
hang.

172
00:11:57,990 --> 00:11:59,730
So be careful with that.

173
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,460
Hyphen hyphen master.

174
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,560
Hyphen size.

175
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,790
Masterson is also 33.

176
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,820
D3 dot I'm going to give here.

177
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:13,580
DT three.

178
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,400
Medium Yes.

179
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,250
Because Master will run many other parts for our different services, for our scheduler at CD, controller

180
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,240
manager for all that.

181
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,860
It will run pods and we will be later running our workload also.

182
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,570
So I'm giving at3 medium.

183
00:12:33,570 --> 00:12:38,280
You can try with T three small as well, but do not use t three micro.

184
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,630
It won't work.

185
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:44,430
It will be dead slow and even will not even create many times.

186
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,600
Hyphen hyphen.

187
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,610
DNS hyphen zone.

188
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:53,470
So that's our zone name.

189
00:12:54,670 --> 00:13:02,680
Subdomain and the domain space backward slash it enter and now hyphen hyphen node hyphen volume.

190
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:05,880
Hyphen size.

191
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,170
Equal to eight.

192
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,800
Now, if you do not specify this volume size, I'm saying it means eight GB for the worker nodes.

193
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:22,130
If you do not specify, it is going to create a very large volume and you can see a lot of bills later.

194
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,890
Hyphen hyphen Master hyphen volume.

195
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,750
Hyphen size is equal to eight.

196
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:36,840
Make sure you definitely give this, otherwise it for a it is going to create huge volumes 120 GB of

197
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:38,010
three volumes.

198
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,230
So keep it to eight.

199
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:41,580
That's minimum.

200
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:46,020
Now this command is not going to create the cluster.

201
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:51,660
Yes, it is going to create configuration for the cluster and store it in this S3 bucket.

202
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,030
So let's hit enter.

203
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,210
So it created the cluster and it stored the information in the S3 bucket.

204
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,000
Right.

205
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,370
So, Control.

206
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,790
See, I'm not running once again.

207
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:14,680
This Now you need to run this command Cops Update cluster.

208
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:18,240
Hyphen f and yes, hyphen f and I mean copy that.

209
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:21,600
And with this, you also need to give the bucket.

210
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,760
Every time you run the cops command, you need to specify the bucket.

211
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,320
Otherwise it won't work.

212
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:35,450
So whenever you make any change to your cops configuration, you say cops have data and will apply the

213
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:36,250
changes.

214
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,820
So we just created configuration for a fresh cluster and we say update cluster.

215
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,750
It will read from the S3 bucket and apply all those things.

216
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,710
And this is going to take some time.

217
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:53,120
So I'm going to pause my video and come back when this is up.

218
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,620
After issuing this command.

219
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,930
Wait for, like 15 minutes.

220
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,700
At least.

221
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,590
And after that, we can verify our notes.

222
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:06,690
Okay.

223
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,640
After waiting for like 15 minutes now I'm going to run this command.

224
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,410
Cops validate cluster and hyphen F and state bucket pot.

225
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:17,800
If everything is good.

226
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,800
It will say your cluster is ready.

227
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,080
Now, that was cops command.

228
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:28,600
Now you have QCT installed.

229
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:37,940
And when you create this cluster with cops, cops will create a file for the Kube CTL command.

230
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:42,890
That file path will be in your home directory dot cube directory.

231
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:44,900
Inside that there is a config file.

232
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,320
This is the file for cube CTL.

233
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,910
We will talk about this file in detail.

234
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,350
In upcoming lectures.

235
00:15:53,650 --> 00:16:00,010
But this file is used by CTL to connect to the cluster so you can skip Ctrl get nodes.

236
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,830
And you see a master node and you see to worker node.

237
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:12,200
Now, if you are excited to look from a console, you can check that also.

238
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,180
Let's go to our console.

239
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:15,880
Okay.

240
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:24,160
You should see in the console one master node and two worker nodes and look at their size and check

241
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,030
the zone.

242
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,350
So one worker is in two way.

243
00:16:27,370 --> 00:16:28,600
Another worker is in two.

244
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,310
B and Master is in two A.

245
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:35,200
Now, this is created by auto scaling group.

246
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:38,380
So if you come to auto scaling group.

247
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:42,620
So you should see three auto scaling group.

248
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,560
One for master.

249
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,760
One for one worker.

250
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,200
And therefore another worker.

251
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,330
Now for.

252
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:51,980
Two worker to different auto scaling group.

253
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,100
That is because they are in two different zones.

254
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,790
Now all this is managed by cops.

255
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,330
Cops will do all this.

256
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:03,830
Along with this you should have a VPC also set up.

257
00:17:04,829 --> 00:17:06,720
So it will be on a separate VPC.

258
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:11,339
So you go to your VPC and you should see a separate VPC.

259
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,510
Also Route 53.

260
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,500
In your home state zone, you will see new records that are created API.

261
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:30,590
Q Bibliography in this point to the master node IP.

262
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:34,730
Then you have internal that points to the master node private IP.

263
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,320
You can see more detail about this node.

264
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:44,330
We have separate cube conflict cube Seattle session where I have talked about these commands in detail,

265
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,460
but this is enough for now.

266
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,200
To set up the cluster.

267
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:53,060
Now, if you want, you can go ahead and delete the cluster whenever you need.

268
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,210
You can create them.

269
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,050
Keep in mind, don't if you keep it running.

270
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:04,360
I will charge you for that because the instance size is bigger.

271
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:05,620
T three.

272
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,040
Small and medium.

273
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:11,410
So if you are not using it, delete the cluster.

274
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,490
Command is simple.

275
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,110
Instead of cops validate, you have to just say cops delete.

276
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,180
Hyphen.

277
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:23,570
Hyphen.

278
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,380
Yes.

279
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:26,720
And they should delete the cluster.

280
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:29,950
Okay, My bad.

281
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:35,590
We also have to give the name of the cluster here because it should know which cluster it is.

282
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,780
Deleting hyphen if a name equal to.

283
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:41,230
And that's not.

284
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,700
That's not the cluster name.

285
00:18:44,230 --> 00:18:49,030
Yeah, they're hyphen fnm equal to the name of the cluster bucket and at the end hyphen hyphen.

286
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,700
Yes.

287
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:53,230
Hit enter and they should start deleting the cluster.

288
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:55,060
And this will take some time.

289
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:03,250
Because it will go through the VPC sort of scaling group DNS record, everything IAM roles, many things

290
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,030
it has created.

291
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:06,850
So it's going to delete all of them and it takes some time.

292
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,610
Once the cluster is deleted is going to give you back your shell.

293
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,810
Do not try to delete this cluster manually.

294
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,960
There are many things.

295
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,450
If you really want to do it manually, then you have to start from auto scaling Group delete.

296
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:26,520
Auto Scaling Group Delete VPC.

297
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,050
Clear DNS Records.

298
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:34,550
And do that only inverse situation where you are not able to run cops cluster command.

299
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:39,710
Now if you want to create it once again, it's just those two commands.

300
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:45,010
Don't remove your prerequisite, Keep your bucket, keep your hosted zone, keep your domain, everything.

301
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,420
Then all you need to do is just run these two commands.

302
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:52,930
Cops create cluster and cops update cluster and your cluster is back.

303
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,490
Once this is deleted, we are going to shut down our cops.

304
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,600
Easy, for instance.

305
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,590
Okay, my cluster is deleted.

306
00:20:01,590 --> 00:20:04,800
Now I can power off this cop's VM.

307
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:09,690
I can just pseudo power off certain spelling.

308
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:16,110
Or you can just go to the CD console and just shut down your cups here.

309
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:23,310
And as I said, whenever you want your cluster back powered on your cops VM login.

310
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:29,430
Cops create cluster, cops update cluster and putting all the commands in the resource section.

311
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,200
That is all in this video.

312
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:34,710
I will see you in the next one.
