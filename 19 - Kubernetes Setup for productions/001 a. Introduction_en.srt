00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:15,580
Welcome to the next project in the DevOps Project series.

2
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:21,820
The name of this project is Kubernetes, set up on local and cloud.

3
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:28,620
We're going to see different ways of setting up Kubernetes cluster, starting from our local machine

4
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:35,580
or laptop to a cloud, a local test environment, and a production grade environment also.

5
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,590
Okay, so let's say this is your scenario.

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,840
You have already containerized your application.

7
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:52,100
You have used Docker or any other container runtime environment and you have created your container

8
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,730
images.

9
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,680
Now it's time to test it on a Kubernetes cluster.

10
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:02,000
And you would like to test it locally and also on the cloud.

11
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,340
So we're going to see also set up local cloud both.

12
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:22,840
I'll get tools that we're going to use for is Mini Cube, which will be used to set up a single Node

13
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,910
Kubernetes cluster locally on our laptop by using Oracle VM VirtualBox.

14
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:33,650
Then we're going to use Q ATM to set up a multi node cluster.

15
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:42,090
We can use Cube ATM to set up production grade cluster, local local data centers or also cloud anywhere.

16
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,090
You just need some set of compute machine Linux operating systems so you can have physical machines,

17
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,060
virtual machines, instances on the cloud.

18
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,880
Next, we're going to use cops.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,250
Cops is a tool to set up a production grid.

20
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:02,990
Cuban This cluster on a cloud and also now it supports Google Cloud.

21
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:11,540
It also has a beta version that supports VMware, vSphere environment, and one of the most famous Kubernetes

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,750
clusters set up tool for us.

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,250
It has its own service, ECUs.

24
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:23,430
We're going to see how we can set up a Kubernetes cluster on x.

25
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,210
X is a service from us, so you just need to run some simple commands and it will have for you a production

26
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,160
grade Kubernetes cluster.

27
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:40,400
In my view, it's the easiest way to have a very efficient Kubernetes cluster powered by A.

28
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:41,270
S.

29
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,430
Okay, So our objectives are very simple.

30
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:52,580
We need to set up a cluster and we need to test the Kubernetes cluster local and on the cloud.

31
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,550
So let's dig in and achieve our goals.
