1
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:01,640
Amazon.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,310
IKEA's elastic Kubernetes service.

3
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:08,300
So you see in shops, we have to do a lot of prerequisites.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,580
Then we run the cops come on and we have the cluster.

5
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,090
Then we have to use COPS command to manage that cluster.

6
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:21,770
Compute resource X is directly a managed service from us, and it's very easy to create a Kubernetes

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:22,880
cluster with this.

8
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,310
And that, too, for production.

9
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:27,290
So let's check the user guide.

10
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,100
You can read about it.

11
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,560
What is X?

12
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,610
In this section, we're just going to see how to create the Kubernetes cluster on X.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,760
So we'll see.

14
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,650
Getting started with X.

15
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,510
So there are two ways to create X cluster.

16
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,960
One is through Sealy.

17
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:46,980
One is through console.

18
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:48,840
CLA is the easiest one.

19
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:53,610
You just need to issue of some long command and the cluster will be up and running.

20
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:56,290
The console way is a long way.

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:08,640
So you have to first install a ally and you have to run some commands to configure CLI.

22
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:15,840
Commands to run Kube Ctl on Mac OS or on Windows.

23
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,430
And then once you're done with those things, you can create an AI role for your X cluster.

24
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,230
Steps are given over here.

25
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,610
I'm running quickly over here because we're going to do it much faster through clean.

26
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:38,850
Guess first thing you have to do in before creating the cluster is you have to create a VPC.

27
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:43,970
And that can be done here through cloud formation template.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:45,010
There.

29
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:51,460
You can copy that and you can launch that template, which will create a stack with all the VPC, private

30
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,680
subnet, public subnet, all those things.

31
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,590
Once your VPC is ready, then you can go to finally X service.

32
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,030
And you can launch your cluster by selecting your VPC.

33
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,060
And then inside that you have to create worker nodes.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,400
So there are really a lot of steps to do.

35
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,080
The much faster way is through x steel.

36
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:19,220
You need a blue collar x steel tool.

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:25,470
You just you just configure it with the access credentials once you have it.

38
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,030
So once you have the X, still see a lie.

39
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:38,790
With right credential, you can just exit and create cluster and you give all the information and it

40
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,910
will create a multi node Kubernetes cluster for you.

41
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,730
I have a much simpler step for this.

42
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:50,340
We are going to launch a Vagrant VM, which is going to set up the tools that we need for EC2.

43
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,610
Then we're going to run this EC2 command and we'll have our.

44
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:56,900
Kubernetes cluster on X.

45
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:08,220
So once you have once we are done, we should see a cluster over here.

46
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:11,200
Right now, there's nothing.

47
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,930
Okay, So let's get started.

48
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,150
We're going to go to our source code.

49
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,090
You should be in this branch covered in this hyphen set up.

50
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:26,850
Get into exe directory.

51
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:37,630
Here you have a vibrant file which is going to execute first a script X Tools Setup search.

52
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:42,840
Accessing it from my sublime text editor X.

53
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:44,940
So that's the background file.

54
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,380
It's a simple VM.

55
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,750
Ubuntu will get created and it will execute the script.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,560
X Tools hyphen Setup search.

57
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:57,230
The script, the Shell script is just going to set up.

58
00:03:58,390 --> 00:03:59,860
It was silly.

59
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:00,790
And.

60
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:01,540
Exactly.

61
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:06,100
So based on your operating system, if you have used any Red Hat machine, it's going to install these

62
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,110
tools, zip and unzip.

63
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,350
If it's open to machine, it's going to say apt install, zip and zip.

64
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:13,360
Once you have zip and on zip.

65
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:16,779
It's going to use this URL to download a CLA.

66
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:18,940
This is a CLA version too.

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:22,510
So don't do a apt install it.

68
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,550
Let me give you version one.

69
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,930
We need version two.

70
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:28,630
So from this URL you can download it.

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:34,210
Then it's going to unzip it and there will be a script install script which will get executed and that

72
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:36,970
is going to set up a SEAL version two.

73
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,370
Once you have a publicly.

74
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:43,830
It's going to download binary of CTL.

75
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:46,100
From that URL.

76
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:55,270
So it will be downloaded in temp directory and then it will be moved to your local bin.

77
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,590
And you can run the command to check the vision.

78
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,520
Then we're going to download Cube.

79
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,330
Give it executable permission and move it to your cell local bin.

80
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,760
So we are having three tools with this script.

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,360
C fly.

82
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,460
ECUs Ctl and Cube Ctl.

83
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:20,080
Once our VM is up after executing all the scripts, we'll log into the VM and we are going to execute

84
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,280
the script x cluster hyphen setup message.

85
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:26,530
We are declaring some variables over here.

86
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:31,810
The cluster name that you're are going to give if you wish, you can change that region.

87
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:38,920
So I'm going to Ohio, so I'm going to select my region as Ohio US East to.

88
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,130
Node name.

89
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,520
So it's going to.

90
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,370
So you don't have a master over here.

91
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:51,650
The service itself is the master.

92
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:55,250
You have the worker node, which we just call it as node.

93
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,110
So we're going to give some name to it.

94
00:05:58,110 --> 00:06:01,260
I'll just give Linux hyphen nodes and a key.

95
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,490
This will be the public key name.

96
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,670
So we have to create a key payer with this name.

97
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,400
So let's go to S.E. to make sure you're in the same region.

98
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,460
Quebecers.

99
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,490
Create keeper.

100
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,770
Okay, so that key will be used.

101
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:30,170
You can use this key to log in to your worker node.

102
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:36,450
Then this command will get executed.

103
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:39,420
If your credentials are set.

104
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:44,580
We have to run a double click to install a double SQL and we have to run a plus configure.

105
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,950
That's mentioned over there.

106
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,030
After that.

107
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,150
It is going to run this command.

108
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,750
If this is successful, your key is verified.

109
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,050
Then this command will get executed.

110
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:05,540
X, it'll create cluster the name of the cluster version, region node group name nodes.

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:11,770
How many nodes we going to with two two worker nodes, node minimum one and maximum four.

112
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:13,610
This is the auto scaling group size.

113
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:16,460
Node type 3t3 Micro.

114
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,020
There's no t two micro here.

115
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:21,380
Node volume size eight GB we are giving.

116
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:27,480
And such access as such public key hyphen hyphen managed.

117
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,860
If this is all successful, I'll script is going to print cluster created successfully.

118
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,890
Else we're going to get a failed message.

119
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:40,880
So all we need to do bring up the VM login and execute the script.

120
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,960
So let's do that.

121
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,590
Let's do vagrant up.

122
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:52,100
Okay, Now the provisioning has started.

123
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,050
It's executing our script to set up our three tools.

124
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,340
E w c Ally Cube, Ctl and X Ctl.

125
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:03,550
Now Cavium is up.

126
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,830
Let's log into it and search.

127
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:12,940
Okay, let's check our three tools.

128
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,450
E w.

129
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,550
S hyphen hyphen version.

130
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,460
It like to.

131
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,020
IKEA's Seattle version.

132
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:29,120
Story in is also there and then Kub Steel version.

133
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,900
Our three tools are set.

134
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,289
First, we need to do a configure.

135
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,789
Access key and secret key.

136
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:40,890
So let's create an IM user.

137
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:45,540
You can use existing IM user that you used for cops.

138
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,850
If you have deleted it, create a new user.

139
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,710
So I'm going to create a new user.

140
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,130
I will limit as x admin programmatic access.

141
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:01,730
Attach policy administrator access.

142
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,200
Go next.

143
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,790
Download credentials.

144
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:13,510
Or I can just copy paste from here itself.

145
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:15,490
Copy the access key.

146
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,380
Okay.

147
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:35,300
A blue collar is set.

148
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,060
Let's go to slash vagrant directory.

149
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,600
And we have the cluster set up script.

150
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,770
IKEA's cluster set up research.

151
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:54,780
If you wish to change some variable names, you can change it.

152
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,520
It's going to set these variables.

153
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,330
And on the command it lists get caller identity.

154
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:08,070
If this is successful, we will be running the command which will create the x cluster.

155
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:13,590
Okay, so let's run the script.

156
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:22,350
Okay, that's working.

157
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,740
Already started deploying the cluster.

158
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:27,340
Okay.

159
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,880
This can turn out to be very expensive if you run it for a very long time, because it is also going

160
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,340
to set up VPC with NAT gateways.

161
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,360
Distributed among multiple zones.

162
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,300
So once you are done.

163
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,310
Checking it, testing it, then deleted also.

164
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,400
Let's go to X and let's see what's happening there.

165
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:54,070
What's.

166
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,170
Refresh this?

167
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,340
Nothing yet.

168
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,570
Let's go and check VPC.

169
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:08,260
Okay.

170
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,540
You should see a new VPC.

171
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,170
This is created by our exit.

172
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:11,920
Come on.

173
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,500
Should see multiple subnets.

174
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:18,870
Six subnets.

175
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,880
Three public and three private.

176
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:24,130
Let's check the nerd gateway.

177
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,260
In that gateway is getting created.

178
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:35,100
So it's going to wait until this Nat Gateway is not up once VPC up with the NAT Gateway, the VPC stable,

179
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:38,550
then it's going to start launching our cluster and that VPC.

180
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,520
So I'm going to pause my screen and come back when this is completed.

181
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,040
It's long time and still the cluster is creating.

182
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,430
But we can see now the cluster creation has started.

183
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:55,590
At least we profile X cluster.

184
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,070
Right.

185
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,000
So this acts like your master notes.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,710
You don't have a master node.

187
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:07,350
After some time you will see in the compute node here, the worker node group will be there and we have

188
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:08,760
said to worker nodes.

189
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,010
So we'll see two compute nodes over here.

190
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,310
This is all done through a cloud formation template.

191
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,440
So if you go to cloud formation.

192
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,710
Should see a cloud formation template there.

193
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,470
The events.

194
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,860
So was creating your nerd gateway.

195
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:30,210
And that is completed.

196
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:34,640
It's two shows in progress.

197
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,530
Resources.

198
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,310
C two group control plane X cluster.

199
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:49,030
So if not with exit command, then you have to do this yourself.

200
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,780
You have to get the cloud formation template, upload it and create the stack.

201
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:02,150
And that requires you to create two cloud formation stack, one for VPC and one for the x cluster.

202
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:06,950
And you have to take care of creating the roles and few other things.

203
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,810
So a lot of steps, really.

204
00:13:08,810 --> 00:13:09,440
So.

205
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:11,260
Doing it through X.

206
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:13,970
CTL is the easiest and the fastest way.

207
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:15,620
All right.

208
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,010
So it says EEGs cluster in this region is ready.

209
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,330
Let's check it.

210
00:13:25,330 --> 00:13:27,610
So you should see to cloud formation template here.

211
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,840
One is for the cluster, the VPC, and then the other one is for the node group.

212
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,610
Let's go to X.

213
00:13:34,670 --> 00:13:36,470
Fresh and it is active.

214
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,400
Click on it.

215
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:43,310
Compute and you should see Linux nodes to desired.

216
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:45,950
So this is running easy to instance.

217
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:49,530
As same as we are running it through cops.

218
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,730
There's an option also to use for Target.

219
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:58,160
And if you wish, you can add here more node group you can add forget also if you want.

220
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,950
App server.

221
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:03,420
End Point is also there.

222
00:14:04,630 --> 00:14:06,760
Okay, let's check the cube config file.

223
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,560
Should be in the home directory of migrant user.

224
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,670
Yes, there's a cube config file.

225
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,430
Let's run it.

226
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,680
You'll get notes.

227
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,480
So you should see the two worker notes.

228
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,030
You'll not see the master node, and then you can run all your test.

229
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:41,650
You can launch pod deployment services, any other object on the Kubernetes cluster.

230
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:42,620
It's going to be work.

231
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:47,500
Same as it works for any other Kubernetes cluster with Cube, CTL Command.

232
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,990
So you see with one simple script that's running this command.

233
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,990
We have a production grid.

234
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,970
Kubernetes cluster up and running.

235
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,210
And also not to mention with VPC.

236
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,430
If you are done testing over here, you can delete the cluster.

237
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:09,440
You should not keep it running because there's also not Gateway Linux nodes.

238
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,500
These two instances and this can turn out to be expensive.

239
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:16,700
So we'll delete the cluster with the cube Ctrl delete cluster.

240
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:20,390
So the name of our cluster we profile X cluster.

241
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:26,070
It's basted tender and it's going to take some time.

242
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:28,830
It's going to create, delete, VPC notes, everything.

243
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,120
So wait until it's completely deleted.

244
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:37,940
If you get any error, you can very easily go to cloud formation templates and delete the stacks.

245
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:41,900
That can be also done and that should be all in this video.

246
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,340
Thank you very much for watching.

247
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,080
I will see you in the next one.
