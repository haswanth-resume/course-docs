1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,340
Now let's shift our attention to production grade Cuba and this cluster.

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,390
By using Cuba idiom.

3
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,530
First, we need to install QB Adam.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,480
So I recommend you read this documentation.

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,410
So we will set up Q bidding cluster on virtual machines.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,880
We'll have 312 VMs, one master and two worker nodes.

7
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:39,430
Here are supported operating system list, the RAM they need and the CPU.

8
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:47,840
And we need to do some initial setup or a prerequisite before we install Q Radium and other tools first.

9
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:56,040
You have to do more probe and load these modules to make sure this option is set to one.

10
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,860
And don't worry, I have all this automated.

11
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:02,010
In Shell script, which we're going to see in a moment.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,470
To set that value to one, you have to update this file with this entry.

13
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:15,730
So you can just run this command so this file gets updated and then you run CTL hyphen hyphen system

14
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:20,530
sys this you have to do on all the nodes master and worker together.

15
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,720
You can set up COVID cluster by using cube EDM and you can use Docker Engine or any other container

16
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:28,620
runtime environment.

17
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,120
You're going to use Docker engine.

18
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,460
So you need to install the Docker runtime environment.

19
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,880
A standard Docker installation is from the Docker documentation.

20
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:48,020
Once you have Docker installed after doing all the setup, then you're going to install Cube Cube let

21
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:49,210
and cube steel.

22
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:57,040
So command to install Cube, CTL, Cube, EDM and Cube led.

23
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,260
And this he has to do on all the nodes.

24
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,410
If you are not using Docker and some other container runtime environment, then you need to make some

25
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,820
C group driver up.

26
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:08,830
But we're going to skip that.

27
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:13,250
Once you're done with this, you can restart the cube lit.

28
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,190
So this common step you need to do in all the work or not once you're done with this.

29
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:29,050
We have to run some command on the master node, which will generate some instructions.

30
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:34,180
And with these instructions we can use to run on work or not.

31
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,580
So work or not can join the master node.

32
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:41,830
The command on the master node will be cue Adam in it with some options.

33
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:46,450
We have to specify the POD network and the API server ID.

34
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:52,610
Once we learn this cube in cube idiom init command, it is going to generate some other commands in

35
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:56,570
the output logs which then can be executed on the worker node.

36
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:01,910
So you will see output something similar to like this when you are in cube in cube idiom and it command

37
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,930
on the master node.

38
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,370
And finally, you will get this in the output.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,690
Commands to create a cube config file and then a command queue idiom join, which will be executing

40
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,620
on the worker node, which will connect a worker node to the master node.

41
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:24,290
But in order to join the worker node to the master node, you need a network.

42
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,520
So kubuntu supports multiple networking models.

43
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,920
You can click on this link.

44
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,980
And based on the requirement, people will use any of the plugin we're going to use Vive Net.

45
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,390
So let's directly scroll down to view net.

46
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:51,340
Integrating Kubernetes and measures via CNI plugin.

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,860
It's very easy to integrate commodities via the add on.

48
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,810
Click on this link.

49
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,400
And you should get a command still apply.

50
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:13,270
It's going to download some Kubernetes definition file and set up a network for your pod to interact

51
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,230
with each other.

52
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:19,769
And that should be you should have a communist cluster by using Cuba idiom.

53
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,910
Let's go through the steps once again and we'll start after that.

54
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:29,350
I'll get forced, will have M.A. and worker node will log into them.

55
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:35,400
If you're going to do predictive sites on all the node, somewhat pro and systems, it'll come on.

56
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:41,500
Then you're going to install Docker engine on all the nodes, worker and master node.

57
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,030
We're going to install Cube, Cube lit and Cube CTL on all the nodes.

58
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,260
Then specific to we're going to log into Master Node, we're going to run Cube in it with some options

59
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,700
which will generate.

60
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:59,350
A command cube CTL node Join qubits or Cube Idiom Node Join.

61
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:04,840
We're going to save this command and we'll log into the worker node and we'll execute that command which

62
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,810
will join our worker node to master Node.

63
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,370
We have some script to save our cube config file.

64
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:18,490
Once we have that, we can log in as an ubuntu user or any normal user and run cube ctrl get node command

65
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,560
to see list of all our nodes.

66
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:25,780
After this, our Kubernetes cluster should be up and running and would be ready to use.

67
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,060
So let's get started.

68
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,640
I know there are a lot of steps to execute, but don't worry, I have most of it automated for you through

69
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,390
Vagrant.

70
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:39,220
So we're going to run the entire setup on virtual machines on our local system.

71
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:45,970
You can use same scripts to set up queue is to set up Kubernetes cluster by using queue atm on anywhere

72
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:50,020
on easy two instances or VM anywhere or even physical machines.

73
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,300
Okay, so let me open the source code.

74
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,080
So we're in Cuba.

75
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,090
So we have a vagrant file.

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,910
We're going to use this vibrant file to launch three VMs.

77
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,130
One is Kubernetes master.

78
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,850
We're going to name it as Cube master.

79
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,830
It's going to be two GB of RAM.

80
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,870
It will have a static IP.

81
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,160
Operating system is open to bindings 64.

82
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:18,570
Open to 18.

83
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,590
Instead of having a vibrant VM, if you choose to have a A++ e, c for instance, you can use that as

84
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,070
well.

85
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:29,470
When this VM comes up, it's going to execute a Shell script.

86
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,590
This is that Shell script.

87
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,970
So first is a variable set master IP, which is its own IP.

88
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,340
It's going to do the prerequisite command.

89
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:47,150
It's going to run, not prop command, it's going to load this module and it's going to create.

90
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:50,420
This file with this content.

91
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:54,780
Then run CTRL system Command.

92
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:03,050
If you're using a center machine, then it's going to script will detect that, find that out and execute

93
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:03,770
command.

94
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:08,800
To install and set up Docker engine on a red hat machine.

95
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:13,310
So basic commands as you see in the documentation.

96
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:17,360
Docker documentation to set up Docker engine.

97
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,210
So these command are going to set up Docker engine.

98
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,830
And then restart Docker engine.

99
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,880
If you're not using Red Hat machine, then it will execute this command.

100
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,520
And this will be good for open to machine.

101
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,350
Again, same command from the Docker documentation to install Docker engine.

102
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:39,860
Once you have Docker engine, you restart the Docker engine.

103
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,810
Okay, next step is to install Cube, Cube lit and Cube CTL.

104
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:55,880
So it's going to set up a repository, enable a repository, and this file document is a repository.

105
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:01,580
So we have to set SELinux to permissive mode.

106
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:04,020
And we are also going to do that permanently.

107
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:11,090
So we're going to change a select enforcing to SELinux permissive in the SELinux config file.

108
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,390
Then we're going to install cube lit cube EDM and cube Ctrl against the Yam command.

109
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,860
So this is for RedHat Machine.

110
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,260
Once you have that, I'm also stopping the firewall.

111
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:26,460
If you have a12 machine, then it will execute these commands.

112
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:33,049
To install cube lit cube EDM and Cube City and stopping the fireball.

113
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:37,750
Once you have that, then it is going to run the cube idiom init command.

114
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,080
This is the main command.

115
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:42,980
We're seeing hyphen hyphen, pod, hyphen Network, CIDR.

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,160
We're giving this IP range.

117
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,500
So this is going to be a support network.

118
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:54,570
We also have to give this option hyphen f and EPA server advertise Address the address of the master

119
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,080
node.

120
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,670
And all the output will be redirected to this file.

121
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,050
Q Bottom out dot log.

122
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:07,020
This file will have the commands which can be executed on the worker node, which we're going to do

123
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,920
automatically.

124
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:12,450
It's going to wait for 360 seconds and execute the script.

125
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,810
Set hyphen cube conflict message.

126
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:16,950
Let's see the script.

127
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:19,220
The script is very simple.

128
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,360
It's going to.

129
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,190
Copy the Q.

130
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,050
The admin dot com conf file.

131
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,000
This is going to be the cube config file.

132
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,120
To the user's home location Kube config.

133
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:34,140
It's going to give permission to that file ownership of the user.

134
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,370
These are the command if you're doing it for any user.

135
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,250
But these are the commands for vagrant users specifically.

136
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:44,200
So you would have a cube config file.

137
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,050
Then you can run cube ctrl command from the master node.

138
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:51,970
So once the script is executed, it's going to run a command cube.

139
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:56,920
It'll apply and apply these definition files.

140
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,340
This is going to create the weave net network.

141
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,180
Then it's going to halt for 60 seconds.

142
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,570
It's doing that to this file, the log file, which was generated by cubed a minute command.

143
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:12,790
All right.

144
00:10:12,790 --> 00:10:17,200
And from this file, you're going to find out the cube idiom, Joint Command.

145
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:20,860
And we're going to put it into this script.

146
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:25,040
And this script will be executed on the worker node automatically.

147
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,320
So all automatic.

148
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,260
So this is the script that will get executed.

149
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,840
Main script that will get executed on the master node.

150
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,360
Q Monster, if you don't want to do it on Vagrant VM, if you want to do it on easy, for instance,

151
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:39,870
just launch.

152
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:46,770
Easy for instance, copy the script over there, make changes on the IP addresses, run the script.

153
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,010
You do make a few more changes.

154
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,650
I have written this script specifically to run on Vagrant VM.

155
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:57,180
But by making few changes, you can run anywhere.

156
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:01,980
But anyways, we're going to use cops to set up Kubernetes Cluster and AWS.

157
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,110
So you can do this on the VMs.

158
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:04,810
Okay.

159
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:08,550
Once the master node is up, it's going to bring up the worker node.

160
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:10,790
So one, two.

161
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,140
Bionic 64.

162
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,480
IP address two GB RAM.

163
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,400
You can set this to one GB.

164
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,780
Also, there should be fine.

165
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,150
So after the VM comes up, it's going to execute the script.

166
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,590
Script cube node.

167
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,130
One hyphen in a dot search.

168
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,210
That's the script.

169
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:31,640
So the script first half is similar.

170
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:38,210
It's going to run the pre request side, the CTL LZ mod install Docker engine based on the operating

171
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:38,840
system.

172
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,520
Similar thing.

173
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:44,590
Disable SELinux, disable firewall.

174
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:51,740
And then install a cube lit cube idiom and cube CTL, same as the worker node, and it will finally

175
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:53,240
run this script.

176
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,150
Joint command.

177
00:11:56,170 --> 00:11:58,650
So this script will get generated automatically.

178
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,490
But I have a sample over here.

179
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,470
So the script will have a command automatically created from the script.

180
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,800
Okay there.

181
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,350
This command is generating the script automatically.

182
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,450
So it will have the command to join, so the script will get executed, will join the worker node to

183
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:22,410
the master node.

184
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:24,720
This will be over.

185
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,440
This is a sample from a previous execution.

186
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:33,710
Once that is done, the worker node will be joined to the master node.

187
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,270
Now No.

188
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,600
Two almost similar Cubano to any such.

189
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,470
Prerequisites.

190
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:47,860
Unless mod still install docker engine based on the operating system.

191
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,650
Said Kubernetes Repository Install Cube lit.

192
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,420
Cube Admin Cube Ctl.

193
00:12:56,470 --> 00:12:58,840
And then finally running the script.

194
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,240
Which will join this worker node also to the master node.

195
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,360
See, all you to do is just get into the van near the vagrant file.

196
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,710
The same directory say vagrant up and wait for few minutes.

197
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,920
In your Kubernetes cluster with Cube, it will be up and running.

198
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,510
Let's test this.

199
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:22,940
If you any time wish to run all these commands manually, you can just copy paste them.

200
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,730
On the shell.

201
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:27,970
You just need to take care.

202
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:32,600
You're going to run master command on master node and node command on the node.

203
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,820
So I'm saying vagrant up.

204
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,520
You forced.

205
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,580
The M.A. is coming up and we'll execute our script.

206
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:50,240
So after waiting some time, the cluster is up, the VMs are up.

207
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,210
We not we don't know for sure whether the cluster is up or not.

208
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,890
So let's log in and find out.

209
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,660
Fragrant as such.

210
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:02,800
Cube master, This is where the cube config file is stored.

211
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:04,610
We're in.

212
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,900
Let's clear the screen.

213
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,530
Q I still get notes.

214
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,260
And we see everything ready.

215
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:15,250
So we have the cube master, which is ready.

216
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:19,580
We're only on Cube Master, Node one and Node two.

217
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:20,870
So it's a three node.

218
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:26,450
And this cluster you should have in your home directory cube config file.

219
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:32,170
You can use this file, copy it in your local machine and you can use Cube Ctrl from your machine as

220
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:32,770
well.

221
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,890
This file is generated when we run the companies cluster.

222
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:44,110
When the medium command, we run and then feed our script, it gets it got copied to the home directory.

223
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,000
We have also copied it to the root user home directory.

224
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,400
Skip config file there as well.

225
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,770
So from root is user.

226
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:59,230
Also you can run cube CTL get nodes.

227
00:15:00,630 --> 00:15:01,800
And that works.

228
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:05,520
Okay, now let's run our usual test.

229
00:15:06,630 --> 00:15:08,550
It'll create cluster.

230
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,880
Mean, we should have given a different name.

231
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,070
Let's give one more.

232
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:15,860
Hello.

233
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,300
Hyphen Cuba idiom.

234
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:21,700
That's the name of a deployment.

235
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,900
And we'll expose it.

236
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,500
Hello, Hyphen.

237
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,870
Q Adam.

238
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:39,860
On board ADHD.

239
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:40,690
That's fine.

240
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:48,710
Okay, so we should have a pod which was created from.

241
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,590
This deployment.

242
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:58,820
And we should also have this service.

243
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:03,750
So the new report is 32748.

244
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,970
You can see much in detail.

245
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:11,210
It'll get poured.

246
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,100
It's a cube.

247
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,910
It'll describe a pod.

248
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,840
And we'll check our pod on which node it is running.

249
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:29,580
So you see that it's running on cubed, not two.

250
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,830
So when you describe your part, it will give you detailed information and you can find out, find out

251
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:35,850
where it is running.

252
00:16:36,390 --> 00:16:37,680
And we have exposed the port.

253
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,510
32748.

254
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,800
Let's test it.

255
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,580
Let's open our browser.

256
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:53,610
So I'll access it on board 3 to 7 four eight as the service has exposed on this port.

257
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:55,650
Right.

258
00:16:55,670 --> 00:16:56,610
So you get the page.

259
00:16:56,630 --> 00:16:57,440
That's awesome.

260
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:05,270
Now, that was about Node two, but, you know, we have a network and we can connect our pod from any

261
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,310
worker node or even master node.

262
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:10,130
So let's try 56.3.

263
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,990
That's cube node one.

264
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,690
That is also working.

265
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:19,640
And we'll also try the M.A. 56.2.

266
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,079
Now it's also working.

267
00:17:22,829 --> 00:17:29,130
So we have successfully verified our Cube Kubernetes cluster, which we created from Cube EDM.

268
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,260
And as in this video we are just talking about setup, that should be all for cube EDM.

269
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,650
Let's hard you can heart or if you want, you can even destroy your VMs.

270
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:43,410
You should have three VMs.

271
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,960
Cube Master Cube Node one.

272
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:45,950
Cube Node two.

273
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:49,490
I'm going to destroy it because I don't need it now.

274
00:17:56,930 --> 00:17:59,180
Okay, so we're done here with cube idiom.

275
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:02,210
Let's now shift our attention to cops.

276
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,000
That we're going to do completely on a.

277
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,900
So let's see what we're going to do.
