1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:08,510
First will go through some companies cluster documentation, which are official Cuban is documentation.

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,490
So let's check them out.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,460
Okay, I'm on Kubernetes, dot IO.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,560
Let's check the documentation.

5
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:18,080
Getting started.

6
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:21,320
Learning environment.

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,000
We start with this first.

8
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,730
Learning communities with Mini Cube.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:34,170
So it is to run Kubernetes cluster locally, meaning Kube runs a single node in this cluster.

10
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:40,260
So all the Cuban is control plane services and the node services will be running on just one virtual

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:40,890
machine.

12
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,000
And there are some features to it installing many cube.

13
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:47,810
So there are different ways of installing mini cube.

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:51,400
We are going to install it on Windows machine by using chocolate.

15
00:00:51,880 --> 00:00:54,640
Once we have mini cube, we can just say mini Cube start.

16
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:57,950
It's going to take a moment, pull the image and bring up a VM.

17
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:02,470
Once our component is cluster is up, we can test it with some deployment.

18
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:06,620
And we can expose the services for deployment.

19
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:09,600
We can see the pots running.

20
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:15,050
You can see the URL and we can access it from the browser.

21
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:22,220
This is just for some local testing environment, just for a little fun and a quick hands on Kubernetes

22
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:22,910
cluster.

23
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:27,020
So first we'll do this, then we'll switch for production environments.

24
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,210
Installing Kubernetes with a deployment tools.

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,470
So we'll use Q radium cops.

26
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:36,980
Q sprays new.

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,560
It uses ansible.

28
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:45,470
We're going to see first Q radium, then we're going to see cops, and finally we'll be seeing X.

29
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,910
So it is a little longer setup.

30
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:56,950
So many steps you have to execute.

31
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:04,970
I have all those steps in some bash scripts and we're going to use Vagrant to provision multi node Kubernetes

32
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,670
cluster by using cube idiom automatically.

33
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,340
So we'll automate the automation.

34
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:15,980
Q Idiom is an automation tool to set up Kubernetes cluster, but there are really a lot of steps, and

35
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:17,930
we can automate those steps also.

36
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,890
Once we do that.

37
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,040
We'll see.

38
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:26,350
Cuban This cluster set up by using cops.

39
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:31,540
We're going to use a cloud platform and set up a Kubernetes cluster.

40
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,360
So we need to set up some tools.

41
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:38,530
We're going to launch a VM for that and we'll run through the setup and cost will the longest setup

42
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,580
that we have.

43
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:44,300
But it will give you amazing control on your Kubernetes cluster.

44
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:51,290
We are also going to see finally Amazon Echo's Elastic Kubernetes Service, which is the easiest production

45
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,710
great Kubernetes cluster that you can spin and manage.

46
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,090
So let's get started.

47
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,080
First, we'll do the mini cube.
