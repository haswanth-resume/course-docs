1
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:08,119
Now, before we start writing definition files for our parts, we have to create a volume for our DB

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:14,630
port so it can store the MySQL data which gets stored in var lib my SQL into EBS volume.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,880
So let's create an EBS volume.

4
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:21,760
It was easy to create volume availability zone.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,070
I have selected us east to a.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,130
Size just three GB.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,240
That should be fine.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,200
Volume type GB two and we got the volume ID.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:32,640
We're going to take a note of it.

10
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,480
For the time being.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,280
I'm going to put it in my sticky notes.

12
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,280
Now we have to make sure when we run our DB port it should be running on a node which is in the same

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,500
zone, same availability zone, and we can make that through node selector option in our definition

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:49,070
file.

15
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:53,840
Node selector works with labels, so we're going to create our own label.

16
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,580
Keep ctrl get notes.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,350
Hyphen hyphen.

18
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,860
Show hyphen.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,340
Labels.

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,130
So we should see the available labels.

21
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,860
They are existing labels.

22
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:09,430
If you want, we can use them.

23
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,650
But we'll create our own label.

24
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,060
Keep Ctrl get nodes.

25
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,410
Let's get the node name.

26
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,780
Keep Ctrl.

27
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:23,070
Describe Node.

28
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,760
And let me check this node.

29
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,230
It's in which zone?

30
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:30,980
So I can grab with us hyphen.

31
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,330
East hyphen two.

32
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,700
Okay this is in US east to a.

33
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:45,490
So this node should be good to run our DB part, but we'll label both the nodes.

34
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:50,500
So it'll label nodes.

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,940
Will select a node name and will give a label called a zone equal to.

36
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,220
US is to a.

37
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:07,870
Let's label our other node with the US East to be.

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:10,090
Now I have selected only these two zones.

39
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:14,710
If you want, you can describe this other node and check in which zone it is.

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,260
Okay, so I have given two labels.

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:29,000
We are done with our setup and the prerequisite that was required to run our project.

42
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,320
Now we'll start writing the definition files.
