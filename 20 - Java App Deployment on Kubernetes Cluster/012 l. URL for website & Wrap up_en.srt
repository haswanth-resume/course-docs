1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:07,170
We have an end point and we can also put this into our GoDaddy or we can also use a Route 53.

2
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,510
Let's go to Route 53.

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,550
We'll put the key name entry.

4
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:14,830
Let's go to hostage zones.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,580
That's our whole zone.

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:20,710
Let's create a record.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:22,450
Simple record.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,520
Okay, we'll see.

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:30,990
I will see.

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,450
Like this blog endpoint will select our load balancer.

11
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:42,430
It's in Ohio.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,470
US is to Ohio.

13
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:50,000
Yeah, that's the one.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:52,720
Record.

15
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:56,120
It's seen a record was taken as a record.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:00:59,670
Okay, let's keep it as it is.

17
00:01:00,940 --> 00:01:03,130
Blog dot cubed or graphy dot rn.

18
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,540
Define simple record.

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:07,170
Let's create records.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,060
Okay.

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:14,040
Let's test it with this URL.

22
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,240
Yeah, that's working.

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:23,690
That's awesome.

24
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,260
You know what?

25
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,120
I'll create an account this time.

26
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:27,380
Create an account?

27
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,050
Username Cube Master Cube at Monster.com.

28
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:37,970
Some fake email address there.

29
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:42,710
To password.

30
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,350
It has to be think a digit.

31
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:46,860
Sign up.

32
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,870
Yes, we're able to also sign up.

33
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,900
This looks pretty neat.

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:01,470
So yes, we have successfully deployed our application to Kubernetes cluster.

35
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,130
By using these simple definition files.

36
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:10,539
We already have all the definition files in the branch.

37
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,480
Q branch.

38
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,270
So if you want, we can check that out before writing it, so you'll have an idea before writing it.

39
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:25,920
So Kubernetes in that you have pro hyphen app and all the definitions files are here, so you can just

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,860
fetch it and you can just say cubes, it'll create hyphen f dot and you know, it will just launch the

41
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,880
entire stack.

42
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,900
And I recommend you go through all the options and write your own definition files.

43
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,120
And that's pretty neat.

44
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
And it's time for the cleanup now.

45
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,450
So let's clean up everything.

46
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,920
Well, if you want to delete your application, you can just skip ctrl from the same directory.

47
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:50,520
Okay.

48
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:58,170
Very high definition file can skip ctrl delete hyphen f dot.

49
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:05,160
That should be done in in a few seconds.

50
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:10,560
And when you're done with your practice, you just delete the Kubernetes cluster with cops, delete

51
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,060
command, and it will anyway, is delete everything inside that, including the load balancer.

52
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,140
So I'm going to say cops delete cluster.

53
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,910
So it's going to wait for some time.

54
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:31,690
And, you know, by the time it will keep attempting re attempting the deletion, once you cluster is

55
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,870
deleted, you can stop your cops instance.

56
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:35,500
All right.

57
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,350
Keep all your dependencies and then, you know, you can launch your cluster anytime you want by running.

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,790
Cops create cluster command.

59
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:43,840
All right.

60
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,290
So that was all in this project.

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,190
I hope you have learned a lot.

62
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:50,050
Thank you very much for watching.

63
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:51,670
I will see you in the next one.
