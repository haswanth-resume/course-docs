00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:12,290
Welcome to the project.

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:17,360
This project is about deploying web application on Kubernetes cluster.

3
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,520
So let's understand our situation first.

4
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,640
We have a multi tier web application stack, which is already containerized.

5
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,680
And we're going to use the V profile Web application, which we containerised in our previous projects.

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,120
So your Web application is containerized and you have also tested it.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,420
Now it's time to host it for production.

8
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Running containers for production.

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:49,730
He's little different.

10
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:59,030
The requirement could be you need high availability so your containers don't go down and also high availability

11
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,740
on your compute node.

12
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,830
The requirement is also for full tolerance.

13
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:12,370
If something happens to the containers and they are not responding, they should also auto heal.

14
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:21,540
It should be also convenient to scale containers and also the compute resource on which your containers

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,260
are running.

16
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:29,000
Platform independent and also portable, flexible, agile.

17
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:35,480
So we should be able to run our containers on local cloud, virtual machines, physical machines, and

18
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:41,810
should be able to run on dev kuah production, different environment easily and conveniently.

19
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,330
We can use container orchestration tool.

20
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,560
Kubernetes.

21
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,180
Kubernetes is today the best container orchestration tool in the market.

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:59,570
It's very mature and a rock solid platform to run your containers for production.

23
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:02,470
Let's also check some statistics.

24
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:13,240
In today's time.

25
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:19,300
Kubernetes is one of the most used tools in the containerized platform, and these statistics are here

26
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,170
to prove them.

27
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:24,880
77% of containers today run on Kubernetes.

28
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,390
If we include Redshift and Rancher, which are already built on Kubernetes, then it's 89%.

29
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:37,750
56% of the organizations have reported that they're going to increase the usage of Kubernetes in the

30
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,920
next 12 months.

31
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:41,380
And that should be by end of 2020.

32
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:50,230
From 2019 to 2020, there's 28% growth in usage of Kubernetes cluster for production containers.

33
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,350
This is a huge number.

34
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:58,660
So we can understand Kubernetes has taken the container orchestration or container world by storm.

35
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:02,290
So in this project we are going to use.

36
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:10,690
Our Java V profile application, which we have containerized and we are going to run it on Kubernetes

37
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,150
cluster for production.

38
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,930
Let's see how we're going to do it.

39
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,910
So we need a Cuban.

40
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,410
This cluster already.

41
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:27,570
And I'm going to use COPS to launch my COVID cluster.

42
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,200
You can check the project of Kubernetes setup where I've explained how you can use crops to set up production

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,580
grid, Kubernetes cluster.

44
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,010
We also need containerised applications.

45
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,900
We are going to use a V file.

46
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:46,130
We have already done a project on container using our Vpro file application.

47
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,860
So these are two main requirements.

48
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:53,830
We need a Kubernetes cluster and we need containerized application and we are using a V profile application.

49
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:58,180
So, you know, in V profile application, we have a MySQL container that needs.

50
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,410
Volume to store its data so we can have persistent data.

51
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:08,200
So for that, we're going to create an EBS volume to run our DB pod.

52
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,020
Then we're going to label Node with zone names.

53
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,950
We're going to create EBS volume in a zone and we need our pod to be running on the same node or on

54
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,310
the same zone where we created the EBS volume.

55
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:28,820
So for this, we're going to label our nodes with zone names.

56
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,960
So when we run our DB part, we'll select Node based on the zones.

57
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:35,480
Once we are ready with all these steps.

58
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:39,640
Then we are going to write Cuban.

59
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,250
This definition files.

60
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,070
To create our objects on this cluster we're going to use.

61
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,760
Deployment service, secret and volume.

62
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,980
So let's make it happen.

63
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:03,130
The only thing I want you to do now is have a Cuban disk cluster created with cops and also take note

64
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:08,260
of your images, which you have created in the Containerization Project.

65
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:10,480
All right, so let's make it happen.
