1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:00,970
Okay.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:06,939
We have to create a service for this DB so our application pod can access it.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,720
So I'm going to say DB hyphen C, IP cluster IP.

4
00:00:10,780 --> 00:00:12,920
We are not going to expose it to the outside world.

5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:17,950
It's going to only for the internal traffic API version.

6
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:22,360
Colon v one.

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:26,990
For the kind service.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,130
Okay, so you give this to line and you say, controller, save it, and it will just show that it's

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,430
a Kubernetes and then you'll get all the help in writing your definition.

10
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:43,530
File metadata name will give the pro DB.

11
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,030
Now, this name is important.

12
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,020
Now all our service definition files will be based on our application properties file for our application.

13
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:58,360
DB v pro db.

14
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,670
That should be the name of the service and port number 3306.

15
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,990
So it should accept the request.

16
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:10,210
The server should accept the request on 3306 and send it to our DB port.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,870
Okay, let's give the specifications.

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:19,080
So ports, of course.

19
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:21,420
Port number 3306.

20
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,480
All right.

21
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,610
Target port.

22
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:30,480
Now we can give the port number, but we have also given name to our port.

23
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:31,200
Right.

24
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,920
So we can just say a pro db hyphen port V pro db hyphen port.

25
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,520
Protocol.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:48,690
Dxb Capital DXB So it's going to accept the request from 3306 and then should send the request to the

27
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:52,160
backend port on 3306 and the back end part.

28
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,260
What should be the back end selector?

29
00:01:56,210 --> 00:02:01,790
App Colon, the pro DB That should be the label of your pod.

30
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:06,870
Their template label app with pro TB.

31
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:10,410
So you should give the same label over here.

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,700
Okay, let's see if this.
