1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,620
Next, Robert McHugh.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,730
Kind deployment.

3
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:11,170
Name Viper MQ zero one as the label.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:15,940
Same label for the selectors replica one.

5
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,670
And this will be the label of our pod.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:25,760
Specification Container Name Wipro MQ zero one Image Rabbit MQ.

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,160
So if you don't have a customized image for this and we don't need it again, this is an official image

8
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,090
from Docker Hub.

9
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:33,810
Port.

10
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:35,170
15672.

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,750
That's the name of the port.

12
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,010
Now we have to set two environment variable over here.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:45,180
One is for the rabbit MQ user and rabbit MQ.

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:47,130
Second is for the rabbit MQ password.

15
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,810
So we're going to say.

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:50,820
E.

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:51,470
And V.

18
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:54,600
First.

19
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,770
Naeem.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,550
Rabbit.

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,040
MQ.

22
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,220
Underscore default.

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,830
Underscore pass.

24
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,110
This is the variable as per the official documentation of rabbit image.

25
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,380
On Docker hub.

26
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,840
So that's the variable you have to assign the value.

27
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,660
And we have already encoded this value in the secret.

28
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:24,650
So we're going to say value from secret key reference.

29
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,080
Key is item Q hyphen pass the name of the secret.

30
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,430
Also you have to give name.

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,090
App hyphen secret.

32
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,420
This is coming from this app.

33
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,540
Secret Arabic Pass.

34
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,260
Secret Name.

35
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:42,500
App.

36
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:42,830
Hyphen.

37
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:43,490
Secret.

38
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:48,540
Also the username.

39
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:49,290
The username.

40
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,070
We can just give just like that.

41
00:01:51,090 --> 00:02:00,840
So you're going to say name rabbit mq underscore default underscore user.

42
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:08,660
And value not from just a value is.

43
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:10,600
Guest.

44
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,260
Guest username and guest password.

45
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,840
Password We have kept in the secret.

46
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:29,120
Okay, cluster I p for this rabbit MQ so I'm going to see item Q hyphen cip, dot y html.

47
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,430
Support 15672 Target Port.

48
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:33,880
Wipro.

49
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,320
MQ hyphen port.

50
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,350
Abraham, You haven't put that on the board.

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,400
Selector app.

52
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,450
Wipro MQ.

53
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,040
Their label app Wipro MQ.

54
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:53,730
So you should match these things.
