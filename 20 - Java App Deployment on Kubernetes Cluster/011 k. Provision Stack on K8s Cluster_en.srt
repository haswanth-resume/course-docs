1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:00,480
Okay.

2
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,080
Let's check.

3
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:04,500
We have a secret file, DB cluster IP cache.

4
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,610
Cluster IP and cache Deployment Rabbit MQ Cluster IP Rabbit.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,690
MQ Deployment.

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:11,850
Okay.

7
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:12,880
I think we're good.

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:13,900
Let's commit.

9
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:22,010
That's it for Profile app services.

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:23,930
Commit.

11
00:00:26,390 --> 00:00:27,560
And let's push it.

12
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:35,280
Okay, Let's fetch it now.

13
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:48,590
Okay.

14
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:50,280
We have pulled all the changes.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,070
Let's do it now.

16
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,610
So Ctrl create hyphen F and I'm just going to say dot, so it's going to read all the definition files.

17
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:01,110
I don't need to do one by one.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,140
Okay.

19
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,120
A few errors we got.

20
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,020
It's a secret already exist.

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:08,910
We probably already exist.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,890
And that's the cluster IP which we created and we deployment.

23
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,470
So these three things you already created previously for testing.

24
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:18,800
So that's really not an error for us.

25
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,050
We could have done apply instead of create.

26
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,750
So if it already exists, you don't get any error.

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,750
And that should be fine.

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,450
Let's check now.

29
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,640
Keeps you till get deploy.

30
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,010
Okay.

31
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:35,880
The pro app is still not up.

32
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,310
I think it's waiting for it back in port part.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,250
Oh, it's still up.

34
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:42,060
Already up?

35
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,320
Yeah, it's up.

36
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,250
Everything is up.

37
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,590
Keep Ctrl, get SBC.

38
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,970
Get load balancer endpoint.

39
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:53,990
Let's copy that and let's test it.

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,120
Okay.

41
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,330
It's not yet up.

42
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:02,400
That's because I think.

43
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,320
And a load balancer would be still doing the health check.

44
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:10,270
Yeah.

45
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:13,590
Okay, health check is happening.

46
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:14,120
Okay.

47
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:15,330
It's in service now.

48
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:22,240
No, it took a while because our application takes some time to come up.

49
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:27,910
Let's log in and try admin, underscore VP, admin, underscore VP.

50
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,100
So we're getting the page from Tomcat application.

51
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,970
This is good.

52
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,420
Let's try log in.

53
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:35,370
If this works, then DB will be also verified.

54
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,730
Yes, we're in.

55
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:40,690
So we're also able to connect to the DB port.

56
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,050
Let's check it out.

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,670
MQ.

58
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:48,560
I would MQ initiated all users for mem cache.

59
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,330
Let's fetch user.

60
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:52,830
Back.

61
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,120
All right.

62
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,790
All the services are verified.

63
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:05,840
So from containerisation of a project, now we are running our containerized application on production

64
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,400
grid, Kubernetes cluster.
