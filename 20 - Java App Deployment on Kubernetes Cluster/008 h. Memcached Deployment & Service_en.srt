1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:01,160
Okay, that's fine.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,230
Let's continue with our next.

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,060
Port definition file or deployment definition file, which is for mem cache.

4
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:14,560
So I'm going to say MSI j deployment dot y html.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:17,380
Okay.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:20,230
This is also this is a simple deployment definition file.

7
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,180
Label app, Wipro MSI.

8
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:30,280
Selector webroot pro app msi replica one single template and the port information.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:39,460
So we have this label for our port app Colon, Wipro, MSI container name Wipro MSI image mem d So this

10
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,270
is not customised.

11
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:46,180
This official Docker image from Docker Hub Official image from Docker Hub.

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:50,800
And we already have that port exposed at 11211.

13
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,360
So we're going to mention that port.

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,260
There's a simple definition file.

15
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:59,020
Let's create a service definition file for this.

16
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,519
We'll see.

17
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:08,040
MCI hyphen c IP dot women.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,600
I just say, remember, don't ask again.

19
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,530
Hoagie Kind Service Name Vpro Cache zero one.

20
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:22,600
Again, this name should be the same as we see in the application properties file.

21
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,240
So yourselves.

22
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:28,140
The service will be running with this name and we'll be listening on request.

23
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,530
One, one, two, one, one.

24
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,190
One, one, two, one one and forwarding it to the pro msi hyphen port, which is.

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,860
The sport.

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:40,970
One, one, two, one, one.

27
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,210
So accept the request on 112, one one for the request on one.

28
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,260
One, two, one, one.

29
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:49,960
Where the selector, where the label is.

30
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,530
That.

31
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,610
Now, this one.

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:58,700
Starting this one, The pro M.S., That's your pot label.

33
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:03,160
Right type cluster IP.

34
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:07,480
Again, I have to mention that over here as well.

35
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,130
Type.

36
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,650
Cluster IP in the DB definition file also.
