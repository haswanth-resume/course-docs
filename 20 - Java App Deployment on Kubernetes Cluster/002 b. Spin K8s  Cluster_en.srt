1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:02,810
I'm on my management console.

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:05,100
I have an instance named Cops.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:08,330
I have done all the prerequisites for cops.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,090
So now just with two commands, I'm going to launch the Kubernetes cluster.

5
00:00:12,810 --> 00:00:19,650
Now I recommend you to pause the video and do all the prerequisites for cops and launch the COVID cluster.

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:26,310
You can check out Kubernetes, set up project, and do exactly the same setup as we did in that project

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,180
for COPS.

8
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:31,350
I'm going to log in to this node now with the cops.

9
00:00:34,990 --> 00:00:38,530
With this command, I'm going to create Kubernetes cluster configuration.

10
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:44,740
First name of my cluster is the Blue Cube, and that's the S3 bucket where I'm storing information.

11
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,790
These are two zones, what we're using to work our nodes.

12
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,080
Size.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:50,840
Two two micro.

14
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,490
Master size two to micro and my DNS zone name.

15
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,810
I'll hit enter.

16
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,630
Now with cops Update Cluster Command.

17
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,940
I'm going to launch my Kubernetes cluster.

18
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:13,600
And that is going to take some time.

19
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:21,390
By the time we are waiting, we'll go to GitHub Repository will keep all our Kubernetes definition file

20
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:22,380
in the repository.

21
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:27,450
So I'm going to create a new repository here named us Kubernetes.

22
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:34,880
Our Ice Cube app.

23
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:38,210
I will keep it public.

24
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,200
Create a repository.

25
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,550
I'm going to clone this repository on my intel ID.

26
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,050
I will say get from version control.

27
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,860
And let's give the URL.

28
00:02:00,550 --> 00:02:03,190
I will keep it in my F drive C clone.

29
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,560
There is a Kubernetes plugin Intel.

30
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,880
We can use that.

31
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,680
Let's go to Settings.

32
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:14,950
Plugins.

33
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,360
And we'll find out there itself, Kubernetes.

34
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,560
Let's click on install.

35
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:25,100
Let's see.

36
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:25,730
Okay.

37
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,680
Okay, Let's check the health of our cluster.

38
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,570
Cops validate cluster.

39
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:35,920
Hyphen.

40
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,240
Hyphen.

41
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:36,450
Yes.

42
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,480
Shouldn't be here.

43
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,570
Okay, so it's good.

44
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,480
We have two nodes and one master node.
