1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:03,390
So the same source code, url.

2
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:06,340
Branch.

3
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:08,510
local-setup

4
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,820
And we have a vagrant dir.

5
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:16,580
In this, we have automated provisioning dir.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,540
In this dir, we have a vagrantfile.

7
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,710
Which we'll see in a moment in detail, application properties file that will be used by our application

8
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:31,730
to connect backend services and some bunch of Shell scripts.

9
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:40,940
If you have not yet cloned the source code, I recommend you clone the source code, git clone and the

10
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,370
URL.

11
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:53,360
So since I already have it cloned and it's in my f drive, I'm going to get into this directory, let

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,020
me expand it.

13
00:00:56,050 --> 00:01:03,360
So, again, vagrant dir, inside that we have automated provisioning and there we have a vagrant

14
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:06,800
file, application.properties file and bunch of shell scripts.

15
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:10,310
This will look much better from sublime text editor.

16
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,370
So let's open sublime text editor.

17
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:16,890
Let's access our source code from here.

18
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,460
So first, we will be seeing.

19
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:37,540
Our Vagrantfile

20
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:44,820
So it's almost similar background file, as we had in the previous project, the difference in this

21
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:51,560
vagrant file is we have shell scripts executing for every vm and the order is also different.

22
00:01:51,990 --> 00:02:00,270
We are setting up db machine db01 and this will execute a Shell script, my sql, which we already

23
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:00,990
have here.

24
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:09,919
So this script will get executed, the script is going to set up my sql Service, initialize the database,

25
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,850
take care of the firewall rule as well.

26
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:23,470
And then next, we will be setting up memcache service, so memcache again, it's Centos7, it's

27
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,140
going to execute the script memcache.sh. This is also a very simple script.

28
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:32,920
It's going to install memcache service and make sure it's up and running.

29
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:43,310
Next, we have a rabbit MQ service, so it's going to bring up our rmq01, C Centos7 and execute

30
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,100
rabbitmq.sh shell script on that.

31
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:47,600
Let's see, this script.

32
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,600
Again, same commands as we executed in the previous project.

33
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,600
With  little tweaks, of course, so it can run automatically.

34
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:05,080
Next service is app01

35
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:10,040
Again, Centos7, and will execute the script tomcat.sh

36
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,200
So this could look a little longer because it's going to also it's not only just going to install Tomcat,

37
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,490
but also going to set up our application, build and deploy.

38
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,700
So first it installs the dependencies JDK.

39
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:32,150
tomcat and it's going to set up.

40
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,340
tomcat service with systemctl

41
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,610
It's going to create the service file.

42
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,130
And once the Tomcat gets service is up and running.

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,740
Cloning the source code.

44
00:03:49,090 --> 00:03:57,420
And building the source code, removing the default application of tomcat, copying our artifact, start

45
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,420
the tomcat service, wait for a few seconds.

46
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,910
And will copy application.properties file.

47
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:15,050
So as every vagrant vm, will have a sync dir /vagrant, so whatever data you see, where the vagrantfile

48
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:20,510
file is located will be synched automatically with /vagrant dir, so our application.properties

49
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:21,890
file will be existing there.

50
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:28,960
So we have to make sure before this comes up, we edit we edit this application.properties file

51
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:35,740
with right details. So before we even provision the stack, we have to make sure we update application

52
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,790
DOT properties file.

53
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:44,890
So backend database information is given db01, username and password, memcache and Memcache port number.

54
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:47,390
Rabbit MQ hostname, it's port number.

55
00:04:47,410 --> 00:04:49,930
username and password.

56
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:57,310
So all the information in this application properties file is based on the script that we are executing,

57
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:02,470
like in my sql, we are setting up the user admin and password admin.

58
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,130
admin123

59
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,030
Right there.

60
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:12,970
So our application properties file also have the user admin and admin123 is the password.

61
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:19,110
So if you make any change to these Shell scripts, make sure you make the changes to the application

62
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,210
properties file as well.

63
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,610
Because our Tomcat Shell script is going to copy application properties file.

64
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,670
To tomcat ROOT directly and then finally restart tomcat service.

65
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,000
OK, last vm from a vagrant.

66
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,300
Its going to be Nginx.

67
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:46,560
web01, Ubuntu operating system, script, it will execute is Nginx.sh., let's see the

68
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:46,980
script.

69
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:55,290
So that's pretty simple, apt update, install Nginx and create the vproapp file.

70
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:07,030
With these settings, so this is the backend server name app 01 and Port 8080 and then move this vproapp file

71
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:16,050
to this directory, remove the default application, create a link and finally start and enable Nginx

72
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:16,750
service.

73
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:21,500
So everything is interrelated together through this vagrant file.

74
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:28,750
So let's get into action now and we we're going to take very little action.

75
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:31,780
Maximum action will be taken by Vagrant.
