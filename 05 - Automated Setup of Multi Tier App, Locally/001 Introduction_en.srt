Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:12,620 --> 00:00:15,600
This is a follow up video from the previous project.

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:20,260
In this video, we will see how to set up this entire stack automatically.

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,090
We are going to run just vagrant up.

5
00:00:23,090 --> 00:00:23,600
command

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:26,540
All the VMS will be provisioned automatically.

7
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:33,080
And also all the services Nginx, Tomcat, Rabbitt, MQ, Memcache and MySQL will be also provisioned

8
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:33,860
automatically.

9
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,030
So a similar design as the previous project, except here, will be having bash scripts that will get

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,380
executed automatically.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,490
And these bash scripts will provision all our services, the entire stack.
