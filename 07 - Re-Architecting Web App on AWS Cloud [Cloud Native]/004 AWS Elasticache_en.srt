1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,170
So next we'll create elastic cache.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:05,240
So search for elastic.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,710
Elastic cash.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:10,970
Yeah.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,730
Their in-memory cache.

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,540
So same thing.

7
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:24,170
Let's create the parameter group subnet group and then we'll create the radius sorry elastic cache instance.

8
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,340
So click on create parameter group.

9
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:29,250
We'll give it a name.

10
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,790
We profile mem cache G parameter group.

11
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:36,830
Semen description I'm giving family.

12
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:40,010
So you see two major family members cash and readies.

13
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:44,420
We need cash D and we will go with cash D 1.4.

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,210
If you see 1.5 that also you can use.

15
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:49,010
But let's go with 1.4.

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,540
And they create.

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,660
Once you create, you should see your parameter group here.

18
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:00,270
And similar thing.

19
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:07,450
As we have seen in ideas, of course, different parameters, but you can select parameters, make changes,

20
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:08,330
save them.

21
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:11,840
But we are keeping all the default parameters.

22
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:13,640
Now let's go to.

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:16,060
Subnet groups.

24
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,590
Let's create the subnet group.

25
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:20,910
So click on create subnet group.

26
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,910
Give a name.

27
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,560
We profile mem cache d subnet group same and description.

28
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:31,280
So we select our default VPC.

29
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,380
And all the subnets in the availability zone are already selected.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,230
If you don't see them, click on Manage.

31
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:41,550
Make sure you select them.

32
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:43,710
And see.

33
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,700
Choose.

34
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,400
Since they are by default selected.

35
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,190
I'll just keep it as it is and I will say create.

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:56,930
So we have parameters group, we have subnet group and we have also the security group that we created

37
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,830
previously.

38
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,590
Now let's go to get started or you can directly go to the cluster.

39
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,040
I'll say get started.

40
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,070
In the cluster, I will just select my cluster.

41
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,270
A cloud.

42
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:14,810
Name.

43
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,890
V profile elastic cache hyphen service See email given the description.

44
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,990
Engine version will go with 1.4.

45
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,220
Parameters group.

46
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,070
We have to select our parameter group that we created earlier Node type.

47
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,240
Be careful over here by default.

48
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,780
It's a very large instance type.

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,220
So we need.

50
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,130
T to micro half a gram.

51
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:47,450
That is fine for us.

52
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:50,350
Number of nude single.

53
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,060
Subnet group setting.

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,480
So anyway selected our subnet group that we created.

55
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,170
So let's keep it.

56
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,550
If you don't see it, select the dropdown, find your subnet group, select it.

57
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,540
Availability zone.

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,570
We will just keep it as no preference.

59
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,900
Just say next.

60
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,180
Security group.

61
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,480
Click on Manage.

62
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,370
Find your security group.

63
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,350
We profile back end as G.

64
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,420
So all our backend services are going into backend security group.

65
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,720
You can select a maintenance window.

66
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:32,340
But I'll just keep it as no preference for any notification you can select.

67
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:37,860
As in this topic, if you don't see your as in this topic, keep it disabled.

68
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,790
That is fine.

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,390
Dagg will see.

70
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,020
Name.

71
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,600
We profile just cash service and see next.

72
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,280
Review all the settings, especially the node type.

73
00:03:56,570 --> 00:04:02,230
You parameter group subnet group security group Check everything and say create.

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,300
So this will take some time to create by the time.

75
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,640
Let's go to the next service.

76
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,060
So create the elastic service and join me in the next lecture.
