1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:01,589
Okay.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,460
Next, what we'll do, we'll create back end services.

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,090
So let's go to ideas.

4
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,820
First, let's create database.

5
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:12,380
Relational database service.

6
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:15,760
Okay, there it comes.

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:18,130
So we will go to.

8
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,880
Subnet groups first will create subnet group and we are going to place our instance in that subnet group.

9
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:29,260
If you have a separate VPC then this is very useful.

10
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:33,560
So let's say create DB subnet group.

11
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,340
Let's give it a name.

12
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,350
We profile hyphen ideas hyphen sub hyphen group.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:41,720
You know.

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,620
I just copy something in the description.

15
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,310
So we have this one VPC default VPC.

16
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:58,390
But in later project, you will see we're going to create our own custom VPC.

17
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:02,320
And we're going to place services in or in our own custom VPC.

18
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:04,810
For now, we'll just select this.

19
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:07,700
Availability zone.

20
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,520
So we'll say all the availability zones.

21
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:14,300
Choose as per the requirement.

22
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,950
And all the subnets.

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,000
In those availabilities zones.

24
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:25,250
Sororities, instance, will be pleased in any of this subnets.

25
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,320
And let's create.

26
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,420
Now let's go to parameter groups.

27
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:40,720
Parameter groups are the setting or configuration of your ideas database service.

28
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,180
Now ideas gives you my skill.

29
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:46,280
Oracle Postgres.

30
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:53,340
Maria Rigby and you do not have any login as such login where you can log into an instance and make

31
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:00,180
the configuration changes of the service or the parameters settings of those service.

32
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,050
So RDA gives you this features parameter group where you can create.

33
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,160
Your own parameter group with all the settings and you can inject to your ideas instance.

34
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:17,400
And this is only if you're a DB geek, if you understand what are the parameters you got recommendations

35
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,620
from the vendor or an architect or a consultant that these parameters, your config configuration you

36
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:24,270
need, you need to change.

37
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:29,010
Then you can create your own parameter group and inject it to your instance.

38
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,680
Okay, so let's create a parameter group and select the service.

39
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,110
So we will be using my SQL.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,190
5.7 or 5.6, but not my school eight.

41
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:46,670
So I'm selecting here 5.7.

42
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:47,550
My skill.

43
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:52,280
And let's give group a name and a description.

44
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,050
And just click on Create.

45
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,740
Now the parameter group is created with default settings.

46
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,040
Default parameters.

47
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:10,000
You click on that and you can see 21 pages of parameters and there are many.

48
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:13,150
If you are a DB geek, go ahead, explore it.

49
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:14,080
If you are not.

50
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,520
Leave them as it is.

51
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,750
These parameters are settings.

52
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:24,170
Are only four people who understand the database parameters or configurations.

53
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:32,090
So if you want to make change, so select your parameter, You can go to first edit parameters and you

54
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:38,900
can find your parameter, for example, password length, and you can mention the length.

55
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,380
And whenever you make any changes, you need to save it.

56
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:43,790
There are some dropdowns.

57
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,780
Also password policy you can drop down and can select it once again, if you know what you are doing,

58
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,930
then only make the changes.

59
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,660
Otherwise leave them as it is.

60
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,950
Cancel editing.

61
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,770
Okay, so now we have subnet group, we have security group and we have parameter group.

62
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,690
He will create this instance and inject all these settings into that.

63
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,940
So let's click on databases.

64
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,750
Create database.

65
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:16,140
And we'll select a standard create.

66
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:19,450
You can easily create this instance by just selecting this button.

67
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,360
But we'll select.

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,800
We'll see all the options.

69
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,350
So engine type, we are going to use my SQL as per our pre profile project.

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,400
But I really recommend you to try Amazon Aurora.

71
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,680
If you have to use my SQL Media debut or PostgreSQL, then instead of this you can try Amazon Aurora.

72
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,390
There are immense benefit offer.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:49,670
There are immense benefits offered like it runs more faster five times faster than my SQL and three

74
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:51,650
times faster than PostgreSQL.

75
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:53,930
With 1/10 of the cost.

76
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,540
So that's pretty amazing.

77
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,400
And if you have serverless architecture, then you can very easily use Amazon Aurora as well.

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:08,990
It has storage, auto scaling and so many amazing and storage, auto healing and so many amazing concepts.

79
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:16,050
So I recommend you try Amazon Aurora, but there will be not a single instance for Amazon Aurora minimum.

80
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:18,710
You have to go with multi AC.

81
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:21,520
So we'll try to keep it.

82
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,750
Low cost, simple, single instance.

83
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,450
For our project, so we'll go with my SQL.

84
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:31,160
Scroll down.

85
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,830
Let's select the version of my skill.

86
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,840
Before I move ahead.

87
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,490
If you do not see the option of my school, go with my advice.

88
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,920
And then again, you need to go back to Parameters group and create parameters for my deep.

89
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:51,530
Because some people reported that they don't see my skull in some region.

90
00:05:51,530 --> 00:05:54,530
So you can use my lab that is similar to that.

91
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:56,410
So we'll keep my skull.

92
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,880
If you're in North Virginia, you should see my skull.

93
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,630
Virgin.

94
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:02,940
We will go with five.

95
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,760
My skill 5.7.

96
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,400
So I'll go with my SQL.

97
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,200
5.7.22.

98
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,400
So any five version is fine.

99
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,990
Come down.

100
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,780
Three templates production dev and test free tier to be on a safer side.

101
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,690
Make sure you select free tier.

102
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,900
So it will use all the free to air settings of ideas.

103
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,340
But I will be going with different test because I want to show you other settings as well.

104
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:41,270
Now the difference between production and dev and test is this production gives you multi AC multiple

105
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:41,720
ideas.

106
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,390
Instance one primary active.

107
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:46,580
Second one standby.

108
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,480
And the volume type also will be provisioned IOPS.

109
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:57,920
It will be faster volume, but you must have already guessed this will not come free and in fact it

110
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,810
is expensive.

111
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,310
So for the project will keep and test.

112
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:06,380
You can keep free tier also so you don't accidentally select any paid service.

113
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:14,420
But I will keep dev and test single ideas instance normal volume type so it will come under free tier.

114
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,370
Let's come down.

115
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:19,410
Okay.

116
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,350
Database name.

117
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:20,830
Let's give.

118
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:25,120
Name v profile hyphen radius hyphen My SQL.

119
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,640
And we'll see the username.

120
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:34,180
We'll keep it the same admin and password we'll see auto generate.

121
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,370
DB instance, class is similar to AC two instances, so be careful.

122
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:44,120
This by default it will be db rm five extra large.

123
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:45,640
And this is MACD.

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:51,020
Then you have our cities and cities, which is considered really good for production databases.

125
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,390
But again, they are expensive.

126
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:59,300
Both classes will go with these are low cost and you have t three micro, you don't have t two micro

127
00:07:59,300 --> 00:07:59,810
now.

128
00:08:00,050 --> 00:08:04,640
But if you want to select TW two micro, you can say include previous generation classes.

129
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:07,520
And then you can find t two micro as well.

130
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:12,850
If you don't find it too micro, you can work out with RT three Micro.

131
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,470
Both are fine.

132
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,450
RT three Micro gives you two CPU.

133
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,520
RT two Micro gives you one CPU.

134
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:24,300
And three micro is also network and storage optimized.

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,000
So to keep it under three tier low cost, go to RT to micro.

136
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,310
I will be keeping it as RT three micro.

137
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,360
Storage minimum.

138
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,830
You can go 20 GB.

139
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,720
General purpose storage for production.

140
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:41,870
Go with provisioned IOPS if necessary.

141
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:42,470
If necessary.

142
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:46,730
If there's too much workload, too much of IO then go with provisioned IOPS.

143
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:50,210
You can even monitor all this from monitoring console.

144
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:53,750
If the IO is high then you can switch to provisioned IOPS.

145
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,560
Enable our storage auto scaling so you can go maximum here.

146
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:08,630
The default value is 1000, so it starts with 20 GB and CO can go maximum till 1000 as we mentioning.

147
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:12,500
Make it easy for production.

148
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,060
Make sure you have multiple you create multi easy.

149
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,090
But for fraud.

150
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:22,400
But again, to keep it low cost, we can create a single instance itself.

151
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,430
That should be fine.

152
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,490
But anyways, go with multi ac.

153
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,780
So I'll have one primary and one secondary.

154
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,650
VPC.

155
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Default.

156
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,260
Subnet group.

157
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,650
We created our own subnet group.

158
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,880
We're going to select that public access.

159
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,790
No, it's going to be private.

160
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,250
Security group will select our security group.

161
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,200
We profile back and see.

162
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,180
Come on.

163
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,600
Okay.

164
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,990
I should cancel this one and select We profile back in SG.

165
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,460
Yes, this is good.

166
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,590
3306 port number.

167
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,400
That's fine.

168
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,230
Password authentication.

169
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,230
Are you going to keep any additional configuration?

170
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:15,860
We would like to have a database named accounts for our V profile project, which will also initialize

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,540
parameters Group.

172
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,080
Select your parameter group that you are going to use.

173
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,400
Regular backup?

174
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,260
Yes.

175
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,730
Backup retention period.

176
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,360
Seven days.

177
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:30,950
You can go as high as 35 days, but we'll keep it as seven days only.

178
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:35,010
You can specify a backup window.

179
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,440
But for now, I'll keep no preference.

180
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,340
We can even change the settings later.

181
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:42,470
Copy tags to Snapshot.

182
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,410
Snapshot.

183
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,450
Enable enhanced monitoring.

184
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:50,450
If you want, you can disable it to save some cost for your project.

185
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:55,150
I'll keep it on, but you can disable for practicing.

186
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,950
You can go as low as one second for the granularity that's going to be too much.

187
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:08,280
Logs, we will say, I want to export all the logs to cloud watch.

188
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
Audit log Error.

189
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,400
Log.

190
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:10,130
General logs.

191
00:11:10,130 --> 00:11:11,360
Quick Slow.

192
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,260
Query log.

193
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:16,630
Let's keep enable auto miner version of grid.

194
00:11:16,630 --> 00:11:19,480
So automatically our database is patched.

195
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,930
Can select a maintenance window if you want.

196
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:26,190
And enable delete production.

197
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:31,750
So it says it's going to cost us around $30.

198
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,890
But that's for a month.

199
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,960
It's a monthly cost.

200
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,530
You're not going to run it for a month.

201
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,430
Anyway, we selected as much as three tier as we can.

202
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,200
Let's create database now.

203
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,470
So this will take some time.

204
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,730
Make sure you save you credential details and copy your credentials to a text file so you can use it

205
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:53,420
later.

206
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:58,790
We're going to feed this information in our application properties file, so make sure you copy this.

207
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,960
So let me use my sticky notes.

208
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:09,280
And copy username and password for now.

209
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:13,660
Melody?

210
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:14,570
Yes.

211
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,790
Okay, So this is going to taste this is going to take some time.

212
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:27,300
So this is going to take some time.

213
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,560
Instead of waiting, we will create our other backend services.
