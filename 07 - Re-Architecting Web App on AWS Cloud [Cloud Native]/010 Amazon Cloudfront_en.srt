1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,630
Okay, so then let's go to cloud front.

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:07,040
It is the content delivery network.

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:17,720
Now, if you're not aware about cloud front, I'm sorry, I should call it as content delivery network.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,220
Cloud Front is the seed of AWS.

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,540
If you do not know what is a seed an.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,920
Then go ahead, read all this and do your own research as well.

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:37,800
It's a pretty simple concept, but it needs vast coverage, multiple data centers around the globe.

8
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:48,480
So your website data will be cached around the world so you can serve a global audience easily, quickly.

9
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:55,590
So once your application stack is up and running, you can use a seed network to distribute your content

10
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:56,280
around the world.

11
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:02,910
So a cloud front or Amazon Cloud front is a seed in which you can use very easily.

12
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:05,630
So let's see.

13
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:07,820
Create cloud front distribution.

14
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,620
First thing here.

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,610
Origin Domain.

16
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:18,120
You can directly select your S3 bucket or load balancer, which is search from cloud front or you can

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,690
give.

18
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,300
Your domain name v profile dot goofy dot n.

19
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,310
That's what I have.

20
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:30,980
I have already updated this in my GoDaddy account, which points to the load balancer.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,810
Or you can directly do the load balancer if you're not going to use the domain name.

22
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,690
But let's use our origin domain name.

23
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:40,460
As we mentioned in GoDaddy.

24
00:01:41,230 --> 00:01:42,610
And let's come down.

25
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:43,720
Or gin pot.

26
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:48,720
Keep it as it is because our application automatically redirects to slash logging.

27
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:50,020
We don't need to mention that.

28
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:52,660
And come down.

29
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:59,160
We were Protocol policy will keep http https if you want to serve both the traffic.

30
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:01,370
Allowed to be method.

31
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,760
I will select all.

32
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:09,770
Get head options put post batch delete, and then let's come down.

33
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,480
You keep all this things default.

34
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,100
Settings.

35
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,440
So this is about the pricing.

36
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,790
If you want.

37
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,070
It was to use all its edge location for the cloud front.

38
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,800
Here, I'll show you 300 plus edge location.

39
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,350
So if you select in cloud front.

40
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:35,420
All education.

41
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:38,120
It will distribute it in all the education location.

42
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:39,320
Or you can be specific.

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:44,630
If you're in North America and Europe, you can just select this and not you as in your users.

44
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:51,260
You can select this one as well, which includes Europe, Asia, Middle East and Africa.

45
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:58,550
We'll keep it all at your location, because I know you people are watching this course from different,

46
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,080
different parts of the world.

47
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:05,770
I also have students in 150 countries, so I don't know where you will be sitting.

48
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:08,210
So it's better to use all edge locations.

49
00:03:08,210 --> 00:03:11,180
So in case you want to verify, you can verify easily.

50
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,060
Okay, let's come down.

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,270
Alternate domain name.

52
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:20,170
We are using an alternate domain name V profile dot goofy dot n.

53
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,100
That's mine.

54
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,780
Put your domain over here.

55
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,620
Your C name.

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,160
We are going with four for three https connection, so we need to select the certificate.

57
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:33,300
So select the certificate, SSL certificate and security policy.

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:38,610
I'm going with the TLS v one Now, for some reason, if your cloud front distribution is not working,

59
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,040
you try switching it back and forth.

60
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,520
Among these different policies.

61
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:50,210
Atlas V one definitely works for our V profile project, so I'm selecting that and then let's come down.

62
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,220
And I think we are good.

63
00:03:52,490 --> 00:03:55,430
Let's click on Create Distribution.

64
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,770
Before that, let's just verify once again.

65
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:05,040
So origin domain v profile dot goofy dot n protocol match viewer were.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,820
Yes, it's good I checked it.

67
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,960
You need to select match we were.

68
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,220
So user access http or https we can serve both.

69
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,930
Okay, let's come down.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:24,860
Use all edge location SSL certificate selector tls v one.

71
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:25,490
All good.

72
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,620
Let's click on Create Distribution.

73
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,790
So it is creating.

74
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:36,010
You see last modified deploying and this may take a very, very long time.

75
00:04:36,010 --> 00:04:40,690
You will see statuses enabled, but the deploying this may take a very long time.

76
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:43,180
So if you need a break, take a break.

77
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,640
Come back maybe like in half an hour.

78
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,840
So I will also pause my screen.

79
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:51,360
Take a break, and then I will come back.

80
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,950
So see you back in a few minutes.
