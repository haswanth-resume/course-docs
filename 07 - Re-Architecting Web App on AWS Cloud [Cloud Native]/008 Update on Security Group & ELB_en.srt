1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:02,570
Okay, so environment is ready.

2
00:00:02,570 --> 00:00:07,550
It's in the OC health state and you should see the URL here.

3
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,840
If you just click on it, it should open the default application.

4
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:15,990
So if you go to an environment.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:19,170
We have here application versions.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,070
You can see there is an application version labeled Sample application.

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,420
This is currently deployed.

8
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,610
We will be deploying our V profile artifact here that will see in the next video.

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:36,750
But before we do that, we need to make few changes in the security group of backend services.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:42,170
Our application from bean stack instance easy to instance.

11
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,890
So if you go to easy to console.

12
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:49,940
You should see these two easy instances created by Beanstalk.

13
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:53,490
Our application will be inside this and this will connect.

14
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,890
To the backend services.

15
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:59,430
Back services will be in the backend security group.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,870
So if you go to security group.

17
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:11,220
We have a high profile bank and security group, so instances in V Profile Java App Prod Security Group

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,780
will connect to back end services which are in back and security group.

19
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,490
So we need to make changes to the inbound rule of back and security group.

20
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,430
So select your back end security group.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,940
Go to inbound rules.

22
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,880
Edit inbound rules.

23
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:33,540
So you see, there are no rules which allows access from the Bean Stack security group.

24
00:01:33,550 --> 00:01:35,640
So we need to add the rule first.

25
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,950
Rule you will add is 3306.

26
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:40,710
This is for the IDS connectivity.

27
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:48,140
So Beanstalk instance, which is in this security group we profile Java abroad, should be able to connect

28
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,120
on Port 3306.

29
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:51,700
Next.

30
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:53,670
One.

31
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:54,870
One, two, one, one, four.

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:55,060
Ma'am.

33
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,890
Cash.

34
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:57,210
Again, select.

35
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:00,790
Dean Stack Security Group.

36
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,010
One more service.

37
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,900
Amazon MQ.

38
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,419
Port number 5671.

39
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:11,700
Again.

40
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,860
Select Bienstock Security Group.

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:20,250
Now, this is very specific based on the specific port numbers, but you can add one more rule.

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,800
Instead of adding all these rules, you can add just one rule, say all traffic allowed from.

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:29,840
Bienstock security group, which is simple rule.

44
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:34,580
But from a security perspective, we should give specific rules.

45
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,710
I will keep both.

46
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:42,620
But if you see your application is not able to connect to back end security group, check your security

47
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:46,520
group rules of background and make sure you add correct rules.

48
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,790
Save Rule.

49
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,360
Inbound rules Created.

50
00:02:50,390 --> 00:02:52,490
Do not touch the outbound rule.

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,200
Just the inbound rules.

52
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,070
So that was about security group.

53
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,940
The next thing we will be doing is.

54
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,390
An environment.

55
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,690
Load balancer.

56
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,150
So let's go to an environment configuration.

57
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,880
And find the load balancer settings.

58
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,490
Edit.

59
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:16,500
We have bought 80 as a listener.

60
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,600
Four load balancer will add one more.

61
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,870
Extra DPS port four for three, choose the certificate.

62
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,250
And see ad.

63
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,170
Scroll down.

64
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:34,750
We see here processes.

65
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,250
Put a checkmark here.

66
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,300
Action.

67
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:41,380
Edit Now this is the health check that we are editing.

68
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:47,020
So our application is living in this URL slash login.

69
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:49,660
So once we deploy our artifact.

70
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,970
And when the application comes up, the URL will be the load balancer endpoint slash login.

71
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:00,120
So health check should be done over there at slash login.

72
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,100
So make sure you update that.

73
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,300
Stickiness in the sessions.

74
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,910
Make sure you enable stickiness.

75
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:15,360
This is specific to a V profile application, so if the user access the load balancer, the load balancer

76
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:21,089
connects to the easy instance, and if stickiness is enabled, it will always connect to the same easy

77
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:21,870
to instance.

78
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:26,400
If it is not enabled, then it may route it to other instance also.

79
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,270
And the user, the current user who is logged in may lose the session as well.

80
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:37,970
So we have multiple instances for high availability, but when the user connects to an instance, the

81
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,360
user is connected to the same easy to instances.

82
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,470
Instance.

83
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:44,540
Sorry, save.

84
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:53,070
If you want, you can store the access log of the load balancer two and three bucket.

85
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,170
You need to create an S3 bucket first.

86
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,360
But we will not select this.

87
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,920
So only two things.

88
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,330
Add four for three.

89
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,860
Select your cert and make sure you change the health check to slash login.

90
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,720
And say apply.

91
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,520
Once you apply.

92
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,750
It will make the changes and the systems, the environment health will transition from okay to severe.

93
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:20,290
That is fine after we deploy our artifact.

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,330
This will come in the Oak State.

95
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:22,960
So.

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:29,620
Apply all the changes, save them and then join me in the next video where we'll deploy the artifact.
