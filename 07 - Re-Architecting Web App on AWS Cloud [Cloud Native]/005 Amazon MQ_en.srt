1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,580
So now let's create rabbit MQ.

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,490
The service name is active MQ.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,110
So search for the service name is Amazon MQ.

4
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,120
If you just type rabbit MQ, it will show up.

5
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:15,710
Select it.

6
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:19,780
Let's click on Get started.

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:23,860
So you have a two engine over here.

8
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,470
Apache active MQ and Rabbit MQ.

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:34,630
We will go with rabbit MQ go next single instance broker is fine, but for production workload you should

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,310
select cluster deployment.

11
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:42,520
But again, in order to keep our project low, cost or no cost will keep single instance broker.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,330
Go next.

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,580
Broker name as a V profile item.

14
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,810
Q broker instance type again, make sure you select the smaller one over here.

15
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:54,210
T three Micro.

16
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,910
There is no T two micro here.

17
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,570
We have T three micro.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:58,750
Rabbit.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,790
You access the username and password.

20
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:05,660
I'll keep the username as a rabbit and password as okay.

21
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
Anyways, I will show you the password.

22
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:13,330
Because I will be deleting this and this will be a private rabbit MQ instance.

23
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,460
You anyways won't be able to access it.

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:19,460
So anything to all characters and make sure you save this.

25
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,800
Before you create the instance.

26
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:24,080
After that, you won't be able to see this.

27
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:27,710
So use capital, small numbers, symbols.

28
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:30,490
Additional settings.

29
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,550
Broker engine version will keep it the default one.

30
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,230
If you want to store the logs of this to cloud watch, you can select this.

31
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,450
But if the log size grow more, you need to pay for it.

32
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,550
So just not select it.

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,670
Network and security.

34
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,100
We will be having private access because we need this as a backend service for our beans stack.

35
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:57,130
For instance, it will be privately accessing rabbit MQ.

36
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:00,850
We are not accessing it publicly over the internet, so we'll keep it private.

37
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,860
Access that will be also safe.

38
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:07,780
Use the default VPC subnet, so we have no separate VPC.

39
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,130
We'll just use the default VPC security group.

40
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,180
We select the existing security group we have.

41
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,490
Yeah, it has already selected that.

42
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:19,610
Now console is getting intelligent day by day.

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,020
And if you don't see this selected, then make sure you select your own security group and uncheck the

44
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:27,400
default security group.

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,160
Maintenance will keep it default.

46
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,370
Automatic maintenance maintenance window will say no preference.

47
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,920
Tag will add name tag.

48
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,130
We profile our MQ zero one.

49
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,950
And let's see next.

50
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,520
So review all the settings, especially the broker instance type.

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,990
It should be t three micro.

52
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,270
Otherwise you will end up paying for it.

53
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,880
Last chance to see your password.

54
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,010
After this, you won't be able to see this.

55
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,990
And they create broker.

56
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:04,810
Now for safety.

57
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:08,470
I have stored the password into my sticky note temporarily.

58
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,060
You can also do that.

59
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:14,630
So all three backend services are created.

60
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:18,670
One last thing left in the backend, which is DB initialization.

61
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:27,410
We need to log into our instance or my SQL login, create database and deploy our schema.

62
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:29,550
So we'll do that in the next lecture.

63
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,640
Wrap this up and join me in the next one.
