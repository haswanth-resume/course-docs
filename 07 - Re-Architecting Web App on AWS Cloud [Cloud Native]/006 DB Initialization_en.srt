1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,810
Okay, so let's go to ideas service.

2
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:10,860
We need to initialize our database so we'll collect information or for instance, its endpoint.

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,180
It should be ready by now.

4
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:18,860
And for this will launch an easy to instance, we'll log into this radius database.

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,110
Let's copy its endpoint by the time.

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
And we'll put it in our.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,030
Sticky notes so we can use it later.

8
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,810
So I'm going to launch an easy.

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:38,320
For instance, let's click on launch instances.

10
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:42,950
Let's name it as my school hyphen client.

11
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,110
So you can give whatever settings you want.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,740
This is a temporary instance just to initialize the database.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,170
Then we'll terminate it.

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:56,490
OS I'll go with Ubuntu to open to 18.

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,270
We'll install my SQL client in that if you prefer to use CentOS or Amazon Linux, that is also fine,

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,220
but you should know what you are doing.

17
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:12,270
The only purpose here is install my skill client, log into IDs instance and initialize the database

18
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:13,710
and then we delete it.

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:19,760
So any linux OS is fine due to micro instance, I will keep it log in.

20
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:23,250
Key will use the same one that we created previously.

21
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,570
You can create your own key over here if you want.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,220
Again, this is just temporary.

23
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:32,820
Okay, So we need to create a security group for this one.

24
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:34,990
A separate one we're going to say edit.

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:42,320
And we'll create security group, we will call it as my SQL client.

26
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,400
SG.

27
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:47,390
And I will keep the description also same.

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,000
The rules will be simple.

29
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,080
We'll just say 22 aloud from my IP.

30
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,800
Or he can keep it anywhere.

31
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,640
So once this is launch, we are going to login and install my SQL client.

32
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:02,760
That's the first thing.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:10,259
If you want, you can use the user data section and you can mention the command to install my skill

34
00:02:10,289 --> 00:02:10,979
client.

35
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:20,410
Pseudo apt update pseudo apt install my school hyphen client.

36
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,580
Oops.

37
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:23,410
Client spelling.

38
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:31,620
Now, if this is sent to us, then the package name is Maria DB in Amazon Linux.

39
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:32,920
Also the package is Maria.

40
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,990
DB if it's open to my skill hyphen client.

41
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,080
Anyways, we'll run this command again later.

42
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,700
Launch instance.

43
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,520
So, for instance, I'd.

44
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,260
Instance, is in running state.

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,210
Let's get its public IP.

46
00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:55,070
Let's log into it.

47
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,280
When two users.

48
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:20,240
First thing I will do, I am going to run app update over here in this instance.

49
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:24,620
I'm going to install my SQL client so I can connect to this endpoint.

50
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,690
Then let's install my SQL client.

51
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,050
My SQL client is installed.

52
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:59,900
Now we can log into ideas endpoint, but the security group will not let us.

53
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,460
Let's try that.

54
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,830
My SQL hyphen edge.

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:07,340
And point.

56
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:13,350
Hyphen your username admin.

57
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:14,820
I would be.

58
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:24,890
So not able to connect.

59
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:31,760
So that's because we have the security group of our back end instance.

60
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,890
It should allow for 3306.

61
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,100
I just search for my school.

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,030
From our MySQL security group.

63
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,030
So this is a security group, for instance, that we just launched.

64
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,950
We give a description.

65
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,640
And let's see rule.

66
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:15,560
Let's check once again.

67
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,230
Just cancel this.

68
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:24,550
Now we are in let's run show databases.

69
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:33,570
So we have the database named accounts and we're going to initialize this database with the schema that

70
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:34,920
we have in our source code.

71
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
So let's come out of this.

72
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,690
And clone the source code.

73
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,090
Get clone.

74
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,740
And the source code URL.

75
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,610
Get clone.

76
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:56,640
Let's get into the repository.

77
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:00,780
So you have to shift to branch.

78
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,850
S refactor this branch.

79
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,340
So let's switch to it.

80
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:12,660
Get check out e w s hyphen re factor.

81
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:19,920
So.

82
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:28,010
Let's get into Z Mane resources directory.

83
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,850
We have DB backup, a skill file.

84
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:35,390
Let's initialize our database with this schema.

85
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:46,780
Accounts and skew input redirection.

86
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:50,270
Okay.

87
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,000
Let's log in and make a test.

88
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:58,820
Show tables.

89
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,020
And we got three tables created.

90
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,110
That's what we need.

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,910
Can exit from here.

92
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,440
Ideas is initialized.
