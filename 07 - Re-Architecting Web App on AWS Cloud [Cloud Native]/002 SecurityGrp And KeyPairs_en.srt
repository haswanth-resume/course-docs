1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:06,540
So I'm logged into my AWS console and I'm in North Virginia region.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:15,070
First thing we'll do is we'll create Key pair, Log-in Key pair for our beanstalk ec2 instance, it's not mandatory

3
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:21,460
to log into Beanstalk ec2 instance, but if you're troubleshooting and we would really like to

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,480
know what's happening inside the ec2 instance, then we can use the key to login.

5
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:30,820
So let's be on safer side create a key pair.

6
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:38,450
So we will name it as vprofile-bean-key

7
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:41,260
And I'll use pem format.

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:46,530
Now, create key pair

9
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,410
So private keys downloaded to my machine abd that is the public key.

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
OK, next, we will create a security group for our backend services.

11
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,650
So let's go to security group.

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:07,040
And will say create security group, lets give security group, a name vprofile-

13
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:11,760
-backend-sg

14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,160
OK, this should be good, lets give some description.

15
00:01:18,470 --> 00:01:21,590
Security group for.

16
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:24,920
Backend

17
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:28,530
services

18
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,730
OK, that's the rule.

19
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:38,240
I'll just add a dummy rule, which will be of no use.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:46,640
I will say that a 22 allowed from my IP now all the backend services that we are going to use elastic

21
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,820
cache, RDS and ActiveMQ, we will create in a private network so we anyways will not be able to access

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,030
from our public network, from the public IP.

23
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:02,720
OK, but we are just creating this giving this rule so we can add one very important rule.

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,000
All the services in this same security group should be able to interact with each other.

25
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,690
So we will say.

26
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,380
All traffic, where is all traffic? There, all traffic allowed.

27
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,770
By itself, its own security group ID.

28
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:26,140
And that could have not been available before creating the security group, so that's why the dumb rule.

29
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,380
OK, let's ssave the changes

30
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,090
We will come back and add one more rule over here to allow access from beanstalk ec2 instance,

31
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:43,570
but for that we need to first create beanstalk instance and then we will do changes in the security

32
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,290
rules.
