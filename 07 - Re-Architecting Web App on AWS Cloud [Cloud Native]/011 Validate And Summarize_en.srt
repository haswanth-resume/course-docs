1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,930
Okay, So after some time the status is enabled, it is deployed so we can again access this URL on

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:11,240
HTTPS protocol from our browser.

3
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,020
But.

4
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:17,730
As a user, we won't be able to see the difference that it is coming.

5
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:25,380
It is sold from the edge location of cloud front or is it coming directly from the instance from that

6
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:26,280
region?

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:33,960
So to inspect that, I'm going to inspect the element while we access the website in our browser.

8
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,620
So I'm opening Firefox here, just a different browser.

9
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,200
So there is no caching in that browser yet.

10
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,370
And I have opened the incognito mode or Firefox.

11
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,980
Just use an alternate browser.

12
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:51,940
Don't use the same browser that you used previously to access.

13
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,470
Your application.

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,260
So I will say https colon slash slash v profile dot goofy.

15
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,000
Dot rn and LP is the URL.

16
00:01:11,230 --> 00:01:16,180
And we'll run F12 and refresh the browser once again.

17
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:19,790
And let's see this.

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:33,400
So you can see via you can see the cloud front near a distribution and point there.

19
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:37,990
So our website is really getting now support from cloud front distribution.

20
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:40,870
And that was pretty amazing job.

21
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,870
Now we have our entire stack and we are using PASS and SAS services.

22
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:50,270
We are not directly using EC2 instances.

23
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:59,600
So we have been stack radius, elastic cache, Amazon message queue and cloud front distribution behind

24
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,230
the scene.

25
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:05,060
Stack is also using S3 bucket cloud watch for monitoring.

26
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,100
So this entire setup is going to give us very low operational overhead.

27
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:16,400
So you do need many admins or many, many cloud engineers to manage the entire setup.

28
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:19,370
So let's revise our architecture now.

29
00:02:19,370 --> 00:02:26,660
User Access Amazon Route 53 to Cloud Front Application Load Balancer, which is part of Bean Stack.

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,410
Monitored by cloud.

31
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,610
Watch alarms.

32
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,830
Artifacts in S3 buckets.

33
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:38,830
Amazon MQ instead of Rabbit MQ AC two instance, we are using Amazon MQ.

34
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,580
Elastic cash.

35
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,110
Instead of using cash from an easy for instance, and Amazon ideas instead of using my SQL running on

36
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,400
an E two instance.

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,450
So if you have hosted Zone in Amazon Route 53, you can even add the entry.

38
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:57,930
Instead of GoDaddy, you can add the entry over here.

39
00:02:57,930 --> 00:02:59,730
It's in the Route 53 itself.

40
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,880
Are you going to use both Route 53 for Subdomain and GoDaddy for the domain?

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,210
Now let's fall back to our Amazon console.

42
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:10,900
We need to do cleanup.

43
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,230
We have not many things.

44
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,780
I don't want you to be running all this if you're not using it.

45
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:21,210
Even though we try to keep things under free tier, but there are storage is volume, there's cloud

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:21,540
front.

47
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,530
It's better we delete everything to save our bills starting from let's delete cloud front so you can't

48
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,280
directly delete it.

49
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,540
First you have to disable it.

50
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,070
And it's going to take some time to disable by the time.

51
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,020
Let's go and start dealing.

52
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,280
Deleting other services.

53
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,460
So ideas.

54
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,100
Let's delete our ideas.

55
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,860
Instance.

56
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,440
So don't copy the final snapshot.

57
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,360
Just say acknowledge and say delete me.

58
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,780
Delete.

59
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:00,200
Let's go to elastic cache Action.

60
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:02,390
Oops, It's not showing.

61
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:03,860
Action.

62
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,810
Right.

63
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,620
After refreshing the browser delete.

64
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,260
Amazon MQ.

65
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,790
Confirmation.

66
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:27,080
Give the name of the broker.

67
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:27,790
Delete.

68
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:34,880
Let's go to Beanstalk, and this will also take a very long time to delete.

69
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:36,790
Select it.

70
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:38,980
First, let's delete the environment.

71
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,610
That's.

72
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,770
Thing that has all the resources.

73
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:49,210
And in application, if you delete or not, it's just going to be a name or container.

74
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,270
So it's not going to charge you anything but delete the environment.

75
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,830
So last thing, make sure you delete your distribution.

76
00:04:57,830 --> 00:05:01,440
Once it is, it says deployed in progress.

77
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:05,120
You will see here it has disabled and this will be deployed.

78
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:08,210
Then you can select it and delete it.

79
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,180
So that was pretty awesome.

80
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,760
We'll see more amazing things on Cloud and DevOps and CCD in other projects.

81
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:21,490
And that would be all in this project.

82
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
Thank you very much for watching.

83
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,730
I will see you in the next one.
