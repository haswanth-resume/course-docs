1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:02,130
Getting started.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:08,670
So now we'll create a repository in code artefact, which will be used by our build job maven, build

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,090
job or MAVEN, build your download dependencies from here.

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,520
So we'll create repository.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:23,790
Okay, let's give the name as v profile hyphen maven hyphen repo and give some description.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,790
So public upstream repository.

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,430
I want to have Maven Central store.

8
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:35,630
So from here it's going to download the dependency and keep it.

9
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:38,900
And we profile Maven repo repository.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,580
Let's go next.

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:41,510
Yes.

12
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:42,870
You want to create it for this account.

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,920
You have to select a domain and it will give a domain name.

14
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,240
So we'll give a domain name as I'm going to give it as visual path.

15
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,080
And this should be good.

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:54,540
Let's go.

17
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,170
Next.

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:59,460
So you see the external connection.

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,300
It is telling.

20
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:01,590
Domain.

21
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,990
It is going to use this visual path.

22
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,020
It will have a Maven central store repository.

23
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,660
We just connected to this group repository.

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,570
So we really created our repository.

25
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,310
Oh, not yet.

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,180
Let's click on Create Repository.

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,330
Okay, let's go to click on Repository and you should see two repositories now.

28
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,070
This is what is going to store the dependencies.

29
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:36,810
So you can click on it and you can see how you can connect to it.

30
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,610
There is a view connection, instruction.

31
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,460
Select package manager MVPs.

32
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:46,470
And so if you're going to use package manager MVPs and if you're going to run like MVPs and install

33
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:48,100
right, we will need dependencies.

34
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,710
So what you need to do, you need to run this command which is going to give you a token.

35
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,060
We have to use an IAM user and we feed the information in settings dot XML file.

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,680
Mr. Information.

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,660
So we'll do all this.

38
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,440
We already have settings dot xml file with the details.

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,750
We're going to just make the changes over there.

40
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:19,490
But before that, we need to export this variable, which actually is going to run a command, a base

41
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:22,150
code artifact, get authorization token.

42
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,060
And this command has to be run with a user privilege IM user.

43
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,710
So we're going to now create an I am user for this.

44
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,760
So let's go back to IM console user.

45
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:42,460
Say add user and we'll limit as we profile hyphen code artifact.

46
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,110
Hyphen admin.

47
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,250
Programmatic access will need for this one.

48
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,030
Policy.

49
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,570
So I'll just say code artefact.

50
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,790
So for this one, you can also create your own policy.

51
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:07,200
But to keep it simple for this one, I'm going to use code artifact admin access policy.

52
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,880
Or you can create your own policy and you can only target your own repository.

53
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,230
So Aaron should be your own code artifact repository.

54
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:19,140
But for now, I'll just keep it.

55
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:21,580
It managed policy.

56
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,660
Let's go next.

57
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,890
Look, I'll download the credentials.

58
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:39,150
Now you need to have a CLI in your system because we going to run that export command.

59
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,520
And we're going to run this command on our local machine.

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,590
So we need a blue collar for this.

61
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:52,410
So from previous project, if you have not installed a blue seal, then I recommend you install them.

62
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,520
So you can do it through PowerShell.

63
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:03,680
PowerShell width.

64
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,070
We have to open with admin run as administrator.

65
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:12,390
And you can use Choko install command.

66
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:21,160
If you have not installed it, install it now.

67
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,900
I already have it installed so I'm not going to run it again.

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,510
So you can run a configure.

69
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:32,980
And set up the credentials that you have just downloaded.

70
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:39,900
So from my credentials file, I'm going to overwrite the existing credentials.

71
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:50,320
Well, anyways, I'm going to delete this user, so I don't mind showing it to you now, but it's quite

72
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,810
very dangerous if you expose this credentials.

73
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:54,850
So make sure you give you a right region.

74
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,900
US East one is right for me, so I'll keep it as it is output for my JSON.

75
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,740
Okay, once you have this setup.

76
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:06,200
Will copy this command and run it.

77
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,490
Which should give us a token and return.

78
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:14,780
Hey, cool Dollar.

79
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:15,960
Let me see.

80
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,080
Does it have value or not?

81
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:19,640
And there's a token.

82
00:05:20,090 --> 00:05:21,860
So we're going to store this token.

83
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,030
Some parameter store from where our code job is going to get it.

84
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:28,520
But now it's time.

85
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:29,360
Before we do that.

86
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,830
Now it's time to change our settings.

87
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,030
Dot XML file.

88
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:34,760
So let's go to our repository.

89
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,230
And switch to.

90
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,290
Sci hyphenate s.

91
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:51,920
So you'll see a settings dot XML file over here.

92
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:57,120
So we have to make some changes over here.

93
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:02,610
So we'll keep username as it goes over there.

94
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:09,150
And there is a variable which we are going to define from some parameters to, as I told you to login

95
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:10,650
and.

96
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:14,560
You are over here repository URL.

97
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,350
So we are going to change that.

98
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:34,560
Copy that.

99
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,250
And let's face it over there.

100
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:44,110
For Miller.

101
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:49,040
So the name domain name here changed the domain name.

102
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,830
To the domain name that you have used.

103
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,940
I have used domain name as visual path.

104
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,750
You can really get the details from here also if you want to.

105
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:10,810
And change this URL as well and make sure to give that a forward slash after that URL.

106
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:17,570
Okay.

107
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,890
This should be good over here.

108
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,530
Let's save and quit this.

109
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:26,380
We will also update our XML file with the URL.

110
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,910
You can keep the idea name same.

111
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,470
It really does not matter here.

112
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,780
Let's just save this.

113
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,000
And we are going to make the chief commit the changes.

114
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:01,180
Get at dot, get comet hyphen, m, c updated poem and settings with code artifact details.

115
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay.

116
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,230
And then we'll push it.

117
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,210
This is going to go all the way to our repository.

118
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:10,780
Oh.

119
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:13,280
Get push.

120
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:15,880
Origin si hyphen.

121
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,060
E.

122
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:16,350
W.

123
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:16,930
S.

124
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:22,500
This should have been updated in our code repository.

125
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,190
I would also like to show one more setting over here to you.

126
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,900
So in that XML file, we have also given one more setting.

127
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,000
In this particular branch, we have the setting.

128
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,110
We are setting up a variable timestamp so it will automatically get the timestamp in this format and

129
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:42,900
this will be used to version our artifact.

130
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:43,929
Okay.

131
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,610
So these two lines there.

132
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:52,130
Which will be useful in the build project.
