1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,390
Okay, So now we're going to set up a code analysis job, which is going to do some honor code analysis

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:09,760
in code build.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:12,470
And for that, we need a sonar cloud account.

4
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:19,630
So you go to SoundCloud dot IO from your browser and you can log in with your gate credentials if you

5
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,730
want GitHub credential or Bitbucket with any of these four, you can create an account.

6
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:26,800
I already have an account with GitHub.

7
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:35,380
So once you log in with your GitHub or any credentials, once you sign up with this, you will come

8
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:36,240
over here.

9
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:43,000
So it will look almost similar to so on the cube server that we have used in continuous integration.

10
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,470
Jenkins project.

11
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:46,690
But this is cloud based.

12
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:51,010
So first thing we'll do over here is we're going to generate a token.

13
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:55,260
So your user go to my account.

14
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:56,990
Security.

15
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:04,310
And give it token name v Profile hyphen Sonar hyphen Cloud.

16
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:06,520
C generate.

17
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:08,710
So you'll get a token.

18
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:11,320
Save it somewhere safe.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,110
For the time being, I'm going to keep it in my sticky notes.

20
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:18,540
Okay.

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,960
Now from this plus symbol see analyze new project.

22
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:29,110
So when you sign up, you should already have an organization name that you have created over here and

23
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:31,840
you can see all the repository from your organization.

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,960
But we are just testing it.

25
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:37,100
We're not going to scan all these repositories.

26
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:39,400
I'll say create project manually.

27
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,150
Okay, so choose the organization.

28
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:52,490
And let's give a project key like we give sonar key sonar project key.

29
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:59,240
Similar to that, we'll give it over here, we'll name it as V profile hyphen repo.

30
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,220
That's all I'll keep the name.

31
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:04,010
I can only go with public because I have a free account.

32
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,479
If you have a paid account, you can go with private also set up.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,770
Okay.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,730
By now, we should have some details.

35
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,900
Let me put them into sticky note.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,120
That's the token.

37
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:22,250
Project name we have is v profile hyphen repo.

38
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:31,900
The sooner cloud URL is https Colon slash slash sooner cloud dot io.

39
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:37,120
The organization I'm using is dev ops at ID Club.

40
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:40,820
That's the name of my organization that I've used in the Cerner Cloud.

41
00:02:41,810 --> 00:02:44,420
There you can see and we profile repo.

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:53,340
So we need this for details and we're going to store this information into a parameter store.

43
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,490
So let's go back to our database console.
