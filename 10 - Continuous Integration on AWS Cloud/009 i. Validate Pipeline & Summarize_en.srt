1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,630
Okay.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:04,550
You can run one more test by committing the code.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,870
So if the developer makes a code, change to the repository.

4
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:14,740
It should automatically detect that and trigger the pipeline.

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,480
Let's test that also.

6
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:18,580
So let's open.

7
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,600
Get back.

8
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,050
You can use the ID as the developer.

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:23,710
Users like Intel AG.

10
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,010
And this is the code comet.

11
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:32,790
Yes.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:36,710
And let's make some changes.

13
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,570
So let's open read me dot MD file.

14
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,910
And just please extra hash.

15
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:52,220
So we're not making any serious code change, but we are making change to some file which should be

16
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:52,940
detected.

17
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,510
Get ad dot.

18
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:59,770
Get comet hyphen M.

19
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,210
Testing code pipeline.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,320
And time to push.

21
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,210
So get push.

22
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,400
Origin ci hyphen.

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:16,610
E.

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:16,930
W.

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,110
S on this branch.

26
00:01:18,110 --> 00:01:27,020
If there is any comment then it should be detected by events, cloud watch events and that should trigger

27
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:27,680
the pipeline.

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,460
Let's check it.

29
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:30,290
Okay.

30
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:31,170
Nothing yet.

31
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,540
Let's refresh the screen.

32
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,060
All right.

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,870
You see that?

34
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:38,050
That started?

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,510
It's in progress.

36
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,920
So you had to wait a few more minutes for this to complete.

37
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:46,100
And then you can see the artifact in the S3 bucket.

38
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:50,720
Now let's reiterate what we did.

39
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,700
So as like a developer makes a code change and commits in the git repository.

40
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,690
The pipeline should get triggered.

41
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:04,790
So latest source code will be fetched in the pipeline.

42
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,600
Then our code build job, which is running sonar code analysis, will get triggered.

43
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:15,230
It will download any dependency from code artifact.

44
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:21,280
And we'll also check for quality gates.

45
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:28,690
If that completed successfully, it is going to run the build job, which is going to generate the artifact.

46
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:32,860
Any dependency will be downloaded again from code artefact.

47
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:37,580
And the resulting artifact will be stored into S3 bucket.

48
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:43,000
So this is a continuous integration pipeline.

49
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:47,890
So no, no need of managing Jenkins server, Nexus server.

50
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,820
So on the Cube server, we're using all cloud based solutions.

51
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:58,240
So people, I recommend you not to delete these jobs, not to delete this pipeline because anyways,

52
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,410
they are not chargeable.

53
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,270
They're only chargeable when you run it.

54
00:03:01,270 --> 00:03:07,000
And if you are free to your account anyways, you'll not be charged for many, many bills.

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,600
Just check the free tier service.

56
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,400
How many hours of free years are allowed in code build?

57
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,600
And I think you have enough number.

58
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:20,860
So do not delete this pipeline because we are going to use this pipeline in our next projects where

59
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,650
we're going to extend this to continuous delivery pipeline.

60
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,280
I hope you have enjoyed this and learned a lot.

61
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,040
Thank you very much for watching this project video.

62
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,960
I will see you in the next one.
