1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,310
Now we have to do one more thing.

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:05,520
We have to set up notification as well.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,810
Before we set up our pipeline, I would also like to set up notification with that and we'll use SNS.

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,940
So we will go to SNS service.

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,160
Okay, So first we'll go to topics and we'll create topic.

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,340
And let's give topic a name.

7
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:33,260
We'll say V, profile hyphen, pipeline and hyphen notification.

8
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,360
And they just create topic first.

9
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:44,940
Once this is created, we'll create a subscription for this topic.

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:47,980
And we will use email.

11
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,570
You can use other things as Q as Lambda IDPs.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:01:00,030
I'll use email here and I'll give the email address that I'm going to use to receive my notifications.

13
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:05,280
Could be a group email for developers or a monitoring team.

14
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,670
So I'll say create subscription.

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,250
And it is pending confirmation.

16
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:21,240
So I have to go to my inbox, look for an email from this notification, and I have to say confirm subscription.

17
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,620
Okay, So in my inbox, I got this mail.

18
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,300
I say confirm subscription.

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:29,470
That's all.

20
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,360
Let's refresh this.

21
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:36,470
It's confirmed.

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:36,690
Now.

23
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,800
I can use this.

24
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:41,740
I will use this on subscription or sorry.

25
00:01:41,770 --> 00:01:46,750
The topic the topic name to send the notification for my build progress.

26
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,310
Let's come back to the code build service and finally, we're going to connect everything together with

27
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,270
the pipeline.

28
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:58,240
And yes, we have to upload the artifact to S3 bucket that also will do after after we create our pipeline.

29
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,570
So I'm going to go to Pipeline and say create pipeline.

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,750
Let's give a name.

31
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:08,550
We profile hyphen sci hyphen pipeline.

32
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,770
A continuous integration pipeline.

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,000
Let it create a role.

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,150
And just go next.

35
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,850
Source provider code commit.

36
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,050
Our repository.

37
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:25,280
And the branch C hyphenate us.

38
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,490
And this we set.

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:33,250
So whenever there is a new comet cloud watch, events will detect that and trigger the pipeline.

40
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:39,250
Or you can use a core pipeline also, this will check periodically, same like we did in Jenkins.

41
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,970
But this is the one that is recommended cloud watch events.

42
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,500
Let's go next build provider.

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,590
The code bill is our bill provider.

44
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:53,450
We'll give the project name.

45
00:02:53,450 --> 00:02:56,480
So first I will add this project.

46
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,800
We profile build project only this project, and then we'll update with other projects.

47
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:03,490
Go next.

48
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,360
Deployer.

49
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,210
I'm going to use a SW three.

50
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:13,010
And this will set later.

51
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,380
We'll just skip the stage.

52
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:16,640
Skip?

53
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,080
And the great pipeline.

54
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:24,650
Okay.

55
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,420
The pipeline already has started.

56
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,760
I will say stop execution.

57
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,930
Stop and wait.

58
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,340
Okay.

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,350
That started this one as well.

60
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,900
Okay.

61
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:46,070
It's trying to stop the build process.

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,900
You can continue it.

63
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,200
Also.

64
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,140
It's not a problem, but I'm going to add a few more jobs over here.

65
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,440
Added the pipeline.

66
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:59,850
First will integrate our test job, the code analysis.

67
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,400
I'll just give the name as test.

68
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:05,790
Add actions group.

69
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,650
Action name.

70
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,530
So honor hyphen Code.

71
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,570
Hyphen Analysis.

72
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,370
Action Provider.

73
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:16,390
Code Build.

74
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,360
Project.

75
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,310
Name e profile build single build and see done.

76
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,420
Now input artifact.

77
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,250
I have to specify the input artifact.

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,570
The source code.

79
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:33,820
The input artifact.

80
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,050
Go ten.

81
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,850
And see done.

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:46,460
Okay, so pulls the code tested and runs the build job to generate the artifact.

83
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Next stage we're going to add is we're going to deploy the artifact to S3 bucket.

84
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,690
So we'll give add stage name as deploy.

85
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,550
Edit Add action group.

86
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:05,200
Action name will say deploy to SE three action provider.

87
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,360
Amazon SE three.

88
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:15,110
Input artifact that gets generated from the build artifact.

89
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,330
So build job is going to generate the artifacts.

90
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,910
So that's going to be the input artifact on this job.

91
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,660
And we have to set a bucket also.

92
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,400
So let's create an S3 bucket.

93
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,430
Create bucket.

94
00:05:33,850 --> 00:05:36,100
So I'll give name as V profile.

95
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,100
And give some number.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,570
V Profile 12.

97
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:43,410
Build hyphen Artifact.

98
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,080
Make sure you create it in the same region.

99
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,680
Create.

100
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:07,260
My search for the bucket that we just created.

101
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:17,370
And in that we'll also create a folder, we'll name it as we profile, or we'll just name it as Pipeline.

102
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,910
If an artifact.

103
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,220
Create a folder.

104
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,660
Copy its name first.

105
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,830
Create folder.

106
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:31,190
No.

107
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:31,500
Sorry.

108
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,160
Save.

109
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,250
Okay, let's go to Code Pipeline.

110
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:40,450
You have to cancel the job and again, create the action C add action group.

111
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,190
Action name deployed to.

112
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,210
Three.

113
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:51,730
Action provider.

114
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:54,200
Amazon is three.

115
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,600
Build artifact for input artifacts.

116
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,430
So our build job generates the artifact that's going to be input for this, and the output will be sent

117
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,390
to the bucket.

118
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,100
Inside this directory.

119
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:17,830
And we'll also say extract, file before deploy or artifact as part of XML file or artifact will have

120
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:21,040
build timestamp also, and it will be a zip file.

121
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,400
So it's going to extract that zip file and then put it into this directory.

122
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,380
Now let's say done.

123
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,320
And is it done here?

124
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,170
And see if the pipeline.

125
00:07:38,910 --> 00:07:39,230
Care.

126
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,080
So.

127
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,100
One is the source code.

128
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,500
Second is the test.

129
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,060
Third is the build job and the fourth is deploying artifact to S3 bucket.

130
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,990
Okay, one more last thing pending.

131
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,100
We have to set the notification.

132
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,750
So let's go to settings.

133
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,310
Notifications.

134
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:01,850
Create notification rule.

135
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,500
So you want to give basic information.

136
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,550
You want to give full information again, based on your choice.

137
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,690
Let's give this notification a name.

138
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:13,470
We profile hyphen, c hyphen.

139
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,590
Pipeline.

140
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:17,530
Notification.

141
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,790
And what action.

142
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,890
So if the job is failed, if it has started, it has succeeded.

143
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:30,440
Or we can just see all and you can just remove what you don't need.

144
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,409
And let's go to Target says topic.

145
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:38,220
We'll keep this topic.

146
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,360
We'll choose our topic that we created and say submit.

147
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,660
Okay, this is set.

148
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:47,580
Notification is set.

149
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,140
Now let's go to our pipeline.

150
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:51,660
And it's showtime.

151
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:54,000
Let's click on a release change.

152
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,130
Release.

153
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,330
So fetch the cord.

154
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:05,350
And it's going to run test.

155
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,530
So I will pause my screen now and come back when this is completed.

156
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:14,040
Okay.

157
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:16,610
After a few minutes, this is completed.

158
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:18,320
The test job completed.

159
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,400
Successfully billed.

160
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:23,360
Job completed successfully, and it has deployed the artifact to S3 bucket.

161
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,640
Let's go and check the bucket.

162
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,300
In the directory.

163
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,020
And we see the artifact with the timestamp.
