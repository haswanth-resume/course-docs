1
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,100
They can done with this.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:06,770
And we'll search for the service.

3
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,430
Some systems manager service.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,620
A very easy way to set up or store variables over here.

5
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:22,260
This secret manager, which is quite expensive, so as you can try that also, but I'm going to go with

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,690
systems manager parameter store.

7
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,180
Here will store these variables.

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:31,220
Okay, so let's create parameter.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:35,730
Forced will create this organization.

10
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,960
Name and value string.

11
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,490
Okay, string text and we'll just you the name of the organization.

12
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,380
Just that.

13
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:53,000
And let's create parameter.

14
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,270
Next parameter will give the host.

15
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,250
That will be our sonar cloud.

16
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,110
You are all.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,670
Okay, So let's create that also.

18
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:14,410
Script.

19
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:18,340
Next parameter name of the project.

20
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,040
Which we have given us a v profile hyphen repo.

21
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:27,670
Create.

22
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:30,430
One more parameter.

23
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,640
This will be our sonar token, the token that we have generated.

24
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,920
And this value.

25
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,050
I don't want to be taxed.

26
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,530
Oh, sorry.

27
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:44,470
Not string value.

28
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,050
Just secure string.

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:53,130
So it will encrypt the value that I put over here because I don't want to show this value to everyone.

30
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,340
Maybe for that reason I will just encrypt it.

31
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,830
Make sure there is not any extra space or anything and just say create parameter.

32
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,410
So we have four parameters.

33
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:12,920
Will also create one more parameter.

34
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,720
And this parameter is for our code artifact token.

35
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,450
So we have executed Cly cli command, which has given us this variable.

36
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:29,140
We exported this variable and we're going to copy this.

37
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:37,940
And we named the parameter as code artifact hyphen token.

38
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,680
Again, this is a token, so I'm going to say secure string and paste the value there.

39
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,180
And to create parameter.

40
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:49,710
All right.

41
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,080
So currently I have these parameters.

42
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,740
Four for Sony Cloud integration and one is for code artifact.
