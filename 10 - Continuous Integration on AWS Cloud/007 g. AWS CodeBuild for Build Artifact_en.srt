1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:04,070
Okay.

2
00:00:04,090 --> 00:00:07,450
Now time to create our next job, which is going to build the artifact.

3
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:11,660
So let's go to build a project.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:12,720
Mm.

5
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,390
We profile hyphen, build hyphen artifact.

6
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:23,740
So score our repository branch.

7
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:24,970
C.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,480
Hyphen a.

9
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:25,780
W.

10
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,380
S.

11
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,610
It's going to be almost similar.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,590
Build spec file will be different.

13
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,920
Amazon Linux open to will use.

14
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,460
Standard image, standard 3.0.

15
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,270
This is going to create a service role.

16
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:48,680
And this also we have to update so it can access the parameter store.

17
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:55,330
This job needs the parameter of a code artefact token.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,960
At one token access, it needs its code artifact token.

19
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:03,000
So for that, we need to update this role later.

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:10,730
Okay, build commands, insert, build command, switch to Ed and let's see our source code.

21
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,790
So I build spec file in the source code.

22
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:19,730
Let's add files and here you have build, underscore, build spec file.

23
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:24,720
So you copy all this content.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,960
Select all based.

25
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,220
Okay.

26
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:43,620
Parameter store variable code Artifact auth token will give it value as code artifact hyphen token.

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:47,070
The variable that we created in parameter store.

28
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,850
So that's only one thing we need to change over here.

29
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:51,360
Install.

30
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:58,680
We need JDBC settings data XML file gets copied, Prebuilt command we are installing.

31
00:01:58,830 --> 00:01:59,940
Let's see it from here.

32
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,020
This is better view.

33
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:02,610
A little bigger view.

34
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:03,900
Right.

35
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:09,660
So installing JDK there we are copying settings dot xml file from our source code to dot m two directory

36
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,220
into directory.

37
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:19,560
Then apt update and we install JQ, we install apache maven extract it, create a link for it, and

38
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,340
then we run the command MV and clean install hyphens.

39
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:24,780
Skip test.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,520
So I don't want to run unit test and code analysis over here.

41
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:35,930
So I'm just going to say skip test and artifacts file and the file, you have to give the list of the

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:36,650
files.

43
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,680
So any file that ends with not valid directory in the target directory, any file that ends with DOT,

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:48,260
where will be our artifact and our artifact will have a timestamp as well.

45
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:51,140
We have updated or a prompt XML file.

46
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,030
So artifact will even have a timestamp.

47
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,870
And that we'll finally upload it to the SD bucket.

48
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,440
So.

49
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,320
Everything copied over here.

50
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:14,320
So here we are not saying anything.

51
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:16,270
Log group name.

52
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,530
So I'll select the same log group that I selected for the previous project.

53
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,660
Logs.

54
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,840
So they have the same group for the screen name.

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,490
I will just say billed job.

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,920
To create build project.

57
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:50,880
Okay.

58
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,560
Last one thing in this job.

59
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,130
Bailout effect job.

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,000
Edit.

61
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,680
Environment will copy the role name.

62
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:10,420
And we'll go to Imam.

63
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,080
Rules.

64
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:15,380
The search for a role.

65
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:19,360
Nope.

66
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,680
Not found.

67
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,020
Oh, I think I need to refresh this.

68
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:23,590
Yeah.

69
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,880
There it is.

70
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:27,260
Attach policy.

71
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,540
We already have a policy created.

72
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,560
We'll use that.

73
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,630
That was for solar.

74
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:35,610
We created the same policy we need.

75
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,560
This policy gives permission to access the same parameter store.

76
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,870
Let's attach this policy.

77
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,010
And we should be good.

78
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,570
Cancel this.

79
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,160
Okay, time to test this job as well.

80
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,530
Let's say start, build.

81
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,900
Single build.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,880
Same branch.

83
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,080
They start build.

84
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:08,680
But it has started to phase details and this will also take some time.

85
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,390
I'll pause my screen by the time and we'll come back once this is done.

86
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,730
Okay, so this job completed successfully.

87
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,990
Can completed.
