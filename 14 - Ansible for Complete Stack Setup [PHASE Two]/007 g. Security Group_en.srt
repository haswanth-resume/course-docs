1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,080
So next thing you know is creating load balancer security group.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:11,260
No, because the model is to underscore group name of the load balancer security group sum description

3
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:18,460
region variable coming from our variable file vpc ID also coming from our variable file.

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:20,790
Yeah.

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:21,370
There.

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:24,580
Region and the VP side.

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,680
Okay, let's mention the rules.

8
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,010
So load balancer security group, you're going to allow Port 80 from anywhere.

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,120
Okay, so list of rules.

10
00:00:39,130 --> 00:00:45,020
First item protocol TCP from Port 82.8 and allowed from anywhere.

11
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:49,090
And of course, if you store the output into a variable.

12
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:52,620
Let's see if it's in the same line as the model.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:53,200
Yes.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,710
Okay, One more security group for V profile is two instances.

15
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:06,340
Again, same model, easy to group name Description Region VPC ID.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,490
I'm going to give one option over here.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,060
Birch underscore rules.

18
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:17,680
No.

19
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:22,870
The reason I'm giving this option is when you execute this playbook, it will create security.

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:27,040
When you execute this playbook, once again, it will once again update the rules.

21
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:28,870
Even if the rules are the same.

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,870
So by default, it's not important.

23
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,970
So this rule, this option purge, underscore rules.

24
00:01:33,970 --> 00:01:35,350
No will make it potent.

25
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:42,400
So if the port numbers, if all the rules are same, then it is not going to do it once again, it's

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,440
not going to delete the rules and recreate them.

27
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:47,140
So let's give the rules.

28
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:54,050
Okay, So 88.80 allowed from Load Balancer Security Group.

29
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:56,160
So we're creating load balancer security group.

30
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,230
We store.

31
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,100
The variable over there, the output.

32
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,420
And in that we have the key group ID.

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:06,080
So I'm going to say allow Port 80 from the load Balancer security group.

34
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:06,770
Okay.

35
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:11,180
There we have CIDR IP because you have to mention IP address here.

36
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:12,570
Here we have to mention group ID.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:16,670
So option is group ID and the group ID from where you want to allow.

38
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:23,850
And under rule 22 allowed from Bastion Security group ID while Bastion security Group ID is nowhere.

39
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:28,320
I've just given that variable, but we have to either define that variable or we have to automatically

40
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:32,100
store it when we execute the Bastion playbook.

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,250
So if we can put this into this file.

42
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:41,690
We need to give the idea of this.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,820
How do we get this idea?

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,450
It's very simple.

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,310
You can execute the playbook once again.

46
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:50,050
You can check it also from a console if you want.

47
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:51,910
But I will execute.

48
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:57,170
Bastion instance will.

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,360
Okay.

50
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,420
Does not print anything.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,850
Let's update this.

52
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:11,400
Now, again, I'm not going to make any updates from here.

53
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,770
We'll do it from ID.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,400
And so far, whatever is done, you can just save it and committed.

55
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,300
And let's pull all the changes first.

56
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,300
Okay, let's go back to our ID again.

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,240
Not my bastion instance y yaml file.

58
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,250
I'm going to.

59
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,730
I'm storing the output of everything k, but I'm not storing it into any variable that.

60
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,030
So if you want to store it into the same file, I don't want to create one more variables file for this

61
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:00,600
all the output.

62
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,290
I want to keep it into the same file vpc output vars file.

63
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,120
So we'll use here.

64
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,820
Not copy module, but another module block in file.

65
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:17,570
So we are going to update this file its variables file with this module block in file.

66
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:19,760
You mentioned the path of the file.

67
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,440
Back up.

68
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:21,740
Yes.

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,620
If you want to take the backup, you can say backup.

70
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,160
Yes.

71
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:31,060
BLOCK And so it's going to add a block or update a block, Insert a block, and the block is just block

72
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,850
of text, right?

73
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,480
So this is the text.

74
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:37,720
And security group ID.

75
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:40,230
Gerri, is your story here?

76
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,660
Also there.

77
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:48,700
Indentation.

78
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,790
That's the biggest problem in Ansible.

79
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,290
How should I say yaml?

80
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,060
Okay, because it's very easy to miss these things.

81
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:00,710
So let's commit.

82
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,070
Let's push the change.

83
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:09,730
Okay, Let's fetch the change.

84
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,040
And let's do the execution now.

85
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,050
Okay.

86
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,110
That made some change.

87
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,160
Let's check that.

88
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,270
Check out variables.

89
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:25,810
Fine.

90
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,450
So you'll see in the output file.

91
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,490
Bastion security group ID.

92
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:34,230
Yet again.

93
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,660
This change is in the control machine.

94
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:40,110
We are going to push it back to GitHub.

95
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,700
Nancy Bush.

96
00:05:58,270 --> 00:05:59,250
Okay, that's done.

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,540
So make sure you pull the changes here so we don't have conflict.

98
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:10,080
Okay, we're getting an error, and that's because of the backup file name.

99
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,910
So it takes backup if given that option, takes the backup of that file.

100
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,210
Yes.

101
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:21,810
And there is this at the rate time and.

102
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,290
This.

103
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,380
Tilda Okay, so this is creating the problem.

104
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,810
It is saying the wrong invalid part.

105
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,980
So let's let's remove that file.

106
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,400
We don't need it anyways.

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,960
We can change its name, but let's remove it.

108
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,550
We don't need it.

109
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:38,090
Really.

110
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,460
I guess we're going to say guitar, right?

111
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:47,210
So it also removes from the index that's committed.

112
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:04,760
I guess every time I do get pushed, I have to enter the username and password to save that time.

113
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,350
You can do search login with GitHub.

114
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,100
But for now, I'll skip it.

115
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,600
Okay, let's go to ID.

116
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,160
Let's fetch all the changes.

117
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,310
Seems like it's done.

118
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:22,120
Let's check.

119
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,650
No, not here.

120
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:24,190
There.

121
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:24,940
Yeah.

122
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:25,930
Good.

123
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,080
And then we can refer that variable.

124
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:33,490
All right.

125
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:40,000
So we profile stack instances can be only accessed from the bastion host.

126
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:43,060
So we have to log into the Bastion host from there.

127
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,700
We have to log into instances which are in private subnet.

128
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:52,310
And for that reason, we have given that Rule 22 allowed from Bastion Security Group ID.

129
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,550
Okay.

130
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,910
Now we have to update one more rule in the same security group ID, the same security group.

131
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:06,060
All our instances will be in one same security group and they will be interacting with each other,

132
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,670
Tomcat, accessing my SQL and accessing my SQL.

133
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,660
So we need to give a rule all traffic.

134
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:16,980
It is all traffic is allowed internally in the security group, same security group.

135
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,950
And for that we have to update the security group rule.

136
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:25,860
Okay, so we are add another task, easy to group, same security group as we are creating here.

137
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:32,610
Same secret group, similar description You can give region VPC ID rules.

138
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,240
No.

139
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,960
Now this ad's very much important.

140
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:43,220
No meaning over here, because we are now going to add rules, protocol, all group ID, its own group

141
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,240
ID, which is we create a security group, store the output.

142
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:52,910
So basically we're updating same security group and we're saying all traffic is allowed from itself.

143
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:59,550
If you have not given this option, then it will remove all the previous rules and add this rule so

144
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,200
it will remove these rules also.

145
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:03,890
So make sure that option is there for rules.

146
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:04,380
No.

147
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:08,070
So it will keep existing rule as it is and add the new rule.

148
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,410
Time to test this.

149
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,560
So let's save Comet.

150
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:29,240
Okay, Let's just check once again.

151
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,680
Indentation.

152
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:35,000
Seems good.

153
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,250
As of now, let's find out.

154
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:44,820
Get pull.

155
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:50,910
Okay, now, this time we'll execute the Playbook approach.

156
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:55,190
See two Previously, when we executed this, it created the key pair.

157
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,270
Now it's going to keep the key pair as it is and create the security groups.

158
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:06,190
Unsupported parameters for module rule.

159
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,610
Okay.

160
00:10:07,910 --> 00:10:11,390
So I have given an option called us rule.

161
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,860
It's actually rules.

162
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,660
So there's a mistake.

163
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,290
So I'll fix it.

164
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,240
It's here.

165
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:23,000
Typographical error.

166
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,410
Very common things.

167
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:30,090
She read the error and you will find out.

168
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,550
Well, the mistake is.

169
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:36,640
Okay.

170
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:40,230
Now let's get bold and try once again.

171
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:54,640
Okay, so it's done, but with some weird output, it's giving warning ran out of time for the security

172
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,120
group.

173
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,190
Let's validate that.

174
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:58,330
The security group.

175
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:58,780
Action.

176
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,160
Let's check our security group.

177
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,780
The LP security group should allow a team from anywhere.

178
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,740
We profile Stack's security group.

179
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:13,520
They should allow aid from the load balancer.

180
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,980
All traffic from Stack is G.

181
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:18,800
That is correct by itself.

182
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,140
And allowing 22 from Bastion hosts G.

183
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,090
This looks good.

184
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:23,770
Okay.

185
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:26,120
So as of now, we're good and we are covered.

186
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:30,860
And it's just a warning, not an error, but may cause some problem later.

187
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,480
So we'll see that later.
