00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:01,680
New file.

3
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,810
Named as a site dot wireman.

4
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:15,670
So the module is import Playbook.

5
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:27,070
And the playbook name VPC hyphen set up dot y mill.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,600
And so because we're expecting that this playbook is in the same directory, which it is.

7
00:00:36,610 --> 00:00:37,450
One more.

8
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,610
Okay, let's see this and let's now commit all the changes.

00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:59,500
So I don't Rimal and Vance update just committed.

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,210
And we'll push it to.

On the branch.

13
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:10,490
We profile hyphens Tag branch, not the master branch.

14
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,450
Let's push.

15
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,910
Because it changes pushed to our branch.

16
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,020
Let's check that.

17
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,400
Let's refresh this.

18
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,960
Okay, so we have a code variable file.

19
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,540
