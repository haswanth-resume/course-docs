1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:03,160
Next step is we're going to create elastic load balancer.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,550
We'll add engine X instance under that.

3
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:12,000
It will be not in service because we don't have any service running on Engine X instance, but we'll

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,830
add it for our third phase.

5
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,770
And while we do that, we'll also do a few more things.

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,940
We're going to take the private IP of all the instances and create a host file.

7
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,110
Okay, so let's go to our ID.

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:30,650
I guess, after creating the instances.

9
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:38,340
I want to really now also print the instance ID I want to show because in the next tasks I'm going to

10
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:41,340
add the IDs, the IP address into a file.

11
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:46,590
So DB zero one underscore out right Under that you have tagged instances.

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,710
Tagged instances and it's a list.

13
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:54,180
And we just need the first element in the list dot.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:57,000
The instance.

15
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,290
Now just have ID.

16
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,030
Okay, This is just for printing purpose, just to show, you know, such kind of information.

17
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:09,740
We're going to store in a file.

18
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:11,780
So this is how we're creating load balancer.

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,580
We have a module called Local Action, and we can local action means it's going to get executed locally

20
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:17,720
and we can give a module name.

21
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,320
Module.

22
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:22,070
That's the module name of our load balancer.

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:29,900
Region, state, present instance IDs so you can add the instance IDs.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:36,010
It's in a list format, so you can add a number of instance IDs if you want to add our engine X instance.

25
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:38,000
So web zero one underscore out.

26
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:41,440
Variable that we are storing.

27
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,210
Here Web zero one underscore out.

28
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:54,730
That's for engineers dot tagged underscore instance zero in square racket dot ID as we are doing it

29
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:55,390
over here.

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,200
Suppose instance it is.

31
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:03,220
If we say true, then it will remove the instances that we have not defined in this list.

32
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:08,169
So under this load balancer, if you have existing instances, those instances will be removed and only

33
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,440
the instances that we're mentioning over here will be added.

34
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,120
Security group.

35
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,700
The security group we created for the load balancer.

36
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:18,700
That's the variable subnets.

37
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:24,340
So this load balancer will get created in public subnet and we're giving the ID of the three public

38
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,760
subnet and which is coming from our output file.

39
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,060
And listeners, you can give a list of listeners.

40
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,100
We just have one listener we're going to listen on.

41
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:39,040
Port 80 HTTP Protocol.
