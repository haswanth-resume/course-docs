1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,359
Next thing.

2
00:00:01,359 --> 00:00:03,160
What I'm going to do is.

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:04,880
The IP addresses.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:10,190
Of all the instances that we created, the private IP, we are going to store it into a file.

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,910
So this task blocking file model we are using, we are going to create a file.

6
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,470
This will be our next execution.

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:24,960
For that, we are preparing variables already and we're going to create a directory provision at HYPHEN

8
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:32,460
Stack Group underscore virus inside data file host IP where we'll have IP address of all the instances.

9
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,830
The private IP is also we need to create these directories, so let's do that.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,240
So we created provision hyphens tag inside that group underscore vars.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,780
Next task we are going to copy our key that we created for our instances to this directory.

12
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,810
Provision Stack will copy it over there.

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,390
In this victory, you're going to write all the playbook to provision our services engine X, Tomcat,

14
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:09,570
rabbit, MQ, mem, cache, MySQL, all the services we're going to provision.

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:12,090
And for that we're going to write Playbook in this directory.

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,300
Next task is to prepare our inventory file.

17
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,650
So we're going to use block in file module.

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,400
We're going to prepare inventory file again, provision hyphen stack directory with the name inventory

19
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,420
hyphen vibro.

20
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,040
The BLOCK will be the name of the host.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,420
Web 0101 RFC 0101 DB zero and Control Machine, which is really the local IP.

22
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:40,520
So ansible underscored host equal to the private IP.

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,510
So like that we prepare the host entry and then we're preparing also groups web server group app server

24
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:48,020
group.

25
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:54,220
DB server group, all these groups and also for the control machine.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:00,160
Also, we are preparing a patent group and all these groups will be the child group.

27
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,920
Of course the username and password.

28
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:09,280
So stack underscore instance the parent group colon vars and we give the ansible underscore user one

29
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,710
two and the private login key.

30
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:17,500
And that's how we can automatically prepare our inventory file as we provision the instance.

31
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,870
So we get the IP address also automatically from this variables.

32
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:27,920
So we don't have to create inventory file manually for our next phase.

33
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:35,020
I'm going to save this file now and I'm going to update one more thing in VPC set up playbook.

34
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:39,270
Where we create these variables files automatically.

35
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:41,520
I also want to put the region over there.

36
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:49,350
So this variable file will also have the region variable automatically when you execute this VPC setup

37
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:50,040
playbook.

38
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:55,170
So we then don't have to manually mention our variables.

39
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,920
Mention the region into this file because this file gets updated every time you execute the VPC setup

40
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,510
playbook.

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,150
So it will overwrite if you don't have the region if you manually mentioned it.

42
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,580
All right, then it's time to do the rest of the things and finish our second phase.

43
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,260
So let's commit.

44
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,820
The changes are pushed.

45
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:26,720
Let's fetch our file.

46
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,410
Let's log in.

47
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:28,550
We got logged out.

48
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,100
Okay, It's done.

49
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,320
Now let's do the execution.

50
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,540
CS.

51
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,110
This file does not exist.

52
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:55,210
We have created the directory but it is not going to keep track of the directory.

53
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,120
So we have to create some empty file in this.

54
00:04:06,050 --> 00:04:07,760
And let's again commit it.

55
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:23,160
All right.

56
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,810
So the execution completed successfully, and we should have new files now.

57
00:04:28,530 --> 00:04:30,120
We should see that file.

58
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,820
Host IP.

59
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,380
So there we go.

60
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:41,980
We have the private IP of all the instances in a variable format.

61
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,980
We should also have the login key copied.

62
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:48,440
Provision stack directory.

63
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,980
And also the inventory file, which is very, very important.

64
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,170
So the next playbook that we're going to write, we're going to use this groups, these hosts.

65
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:07,710
And we created the inventory file automatically by using a register to store the output and then use

66
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:12,780
the keys from that and get the IP address and also getting the ID.

67
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:16,590
All right.

68
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:19,350
So a second phase execution completed.

69
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,750
We'll verify everything once again.

70
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:23,400
We have all the instances.

71
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:27,800
We should also have a load balancer.

72
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,080
There's this instance, Web zero one.

73
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:38,620
It will be out of service because the Internet service is not yet running over there.

74
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,740
We're going to do that in the third phase.
