1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:03,280
Okay, so let's do the execution.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,160
Ansible hyphen playbook ci dot AML.

3
00:00:15,470 --> 00:00:16,630
So it's creating everything.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,680
VPC all our subnets.

5
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,250
Internet Gateway Route table for Internet Gateway.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,840
Now it's creating the net gateway, which will take some time.

7
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,260
So I'm going to pause my screen and come back when this is completed.

8
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,450
So VPC set up, but when we're creating Bastion host, it failed.

9
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:41,570
That's because we have removed the Bastion host variables file but we did not make the change in the

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:44,340
Bastion instance yaml.

11
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:47,130
There.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,870
It's important.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,790
It's trying to include that variables file which does not exist.

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,820
Instead of that, we have the VPC variable file that we have to import.

15
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,030
So let's do it again from our ID.

16
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,560
That's an instance.

17
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:08,450
Not that we need VPC.

18
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:09,450
Underscore Setup.

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,510
VPC.

20
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,500
Underscore.

21
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:13,400
Set up.

22
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,440
Let's save it.

23
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,210
Committed.

24
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,100
Completed vars file in Bastion.

25
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,190
And let's push the change.

26
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,840
Okay, let's fetch it.

27
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,930
Okay, let's try the execution once again.

28
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:50,260
So we already set up all subnets.

29
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,040
Everything is good.

30
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,600
So it's just going to say, okay.

31
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,450
And this looks good.

32
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:56,560
Now it's importing.

33
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,270
It has imported the variables file.

34
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:03,760
Created security group, for Bastion instance, and it has stopped launching the Bastion host.

35
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,930
Yeah, worse.

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:10,090
We pick out set up variable.

37
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:17,170
If you have not updated your my IP over here, make sure you change that and you can reapply the change

38
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:17,920
if you want.

39
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:37,990
Okay, we should have output vars file and we have all the information, all the IDs of VPC, subnet,

40
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,460
internet gateway, everything.

41
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,580
We should be a very vital information for our next execution.

42
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,600
So our first execution completed, we should have VPC with all the details.

43
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,730
Second execution.

44
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,990
We are going to write a playbook to set up our easy two instances load balancer and security group for

45
00:02:52,990 --> 00:02:54,430
our V profile stack.
