1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,680
Okay, let's get started.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:11,280
I am in my Intel ID source code from the VPC setup project, so we have the VPC setup playbook there.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,280
Variables that we used previously.

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:25,100
And output underscore vars, which will be very useful in this project execution.

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,560
So we had a VPC setup playbook.

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,540
Bastion host set up playbook.

7
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,440
And we are continuously putting it in our GitHub.

8
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:40,230
You know, repository.

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,400
What will do will not touch this code, will create a separate branch, will name it as a V profile

10
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:48,510
stack.

11
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,600
So we created a new branch.

12
00:00:56,610 --> 00:00:58,680
Let's fetch that.

13
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:12,570
All right.

14
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,760
And we switch to that branch and let's start making changes somehow.

15
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:19,920
So, Bastian, set up variables.

16
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,960
I'm going to take this.

17
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,850
Variables and we'll put it in a VPC set of variables.

18
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,310
So we'll merge both the variables file.

19
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:35,830
So regions already region is already mentioned.

20
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,130
So let's remove that.

21
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:41,760
Dustin Vase.

22
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,740
Since it's there, let's remove this bastion set file.

23
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:50,100
You don't need this.

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:01,800
Now we'll create a common Playbook site which will call these two Playbook VP's setup and Bastion Setup

25
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,520
Playbook.
