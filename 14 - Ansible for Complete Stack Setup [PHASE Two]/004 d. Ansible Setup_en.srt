1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,030
Now we'll launch an easy to instance, install Ansible in that and fetch this code and execute.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:09,710
So let's launch instance again.

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:11,120
I'm in Ohio region.

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,190
And I'll go with Open to 20.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:18,650
D2 Micro should be fine.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:21,880
And let's provision it with Ansible.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,350
But also where to install will install it after it comes up.

8
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:44,530
Mm.

9
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:45,400
Controller.

10
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,030
I'm going to select the same security group.

11
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,440
Now.

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:52,430
I already have.

13
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,350
And the same login key.

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:05,269
Instance, is running.

15
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,340
I will update the security group.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:12,330
To allow connection from my IP if it changed.

17
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:13,470
Yes, it changed.

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,320
And let's log into this instance.

19
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:42,620
Instance is up.

20
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:45,010
We logged in.

21
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:46,930
Let's check the Ansible version.

22
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:51,860
To be good.

23
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:59,900
Now, other two things we're going to install bottle and we're going to also attach item policy so this

24
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,300
instance can access ADA services.

25
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,750
So we'll install python three, hyphen bottle, three python three hyphen bottle code, which anyways

26
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:12,380
gets installed as a dependency, then python three hyphen bottle.

27
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:13,880
Let's install.

28
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:18,820
Okay, that's done.

29
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,310
Let's attach an item roll.

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,270
If you don't have it all, if you delete it, then recreate the IM role.

31
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,730
Which has full access.

32
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,970
To all the services.

33
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,020
Let's attach that.

34
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,000
I am role to our instance.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,630
Now let's fetch our source code.

36
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:50,290
Get clone and let's get the repository URL.

37
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,660
So you should have also the repository that you created.

38
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:01,970
In previous projects you can use that or either you can use our project repository there.

39
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:03,530
Also, we have all this.

40
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:08,810
If you have not created a repository, then whatever code that you have written in the previous project,

41
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,150
you can just copy to the control machine.

42
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:12,230
You can use CB.

43
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:18,620
Let's get into the repository.

44
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,890
And we'll see the branch.

45
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:28,390
So we just created a branch that we will check out to that branch.

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,510
Kid, Check out the profile stack.

47
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:36,870
Right.

48
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:43,050
So we have Sitewide playbook that is going to in turn call VPC, set up Playbook and Bastion instance,

49
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:43,980
set up playbook.

50
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,590
It will need variables from the vast directory.

51
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,310
So we have the variables and this output vars.

52
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,210
If you want we can delete.

53
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,320
It will be no new file now to generate a new file anyways, if the file exists, can override that file.
