1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,150
After this.

2
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:08,050
Before we move to the third phase, we will copy all this valuable information to our repository.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:12,050
So let's get ad dot, get commit.

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,240
If your name.

5
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:22,210
And we'll push it.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,100
Don't forget to fetch it in your ID.

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:27,270
All the changes.

8
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:37,960
Okay, So you'll see the host types, the groupers, you have the host types, then you have inventory

9
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,620
file.

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:44,840
Again, keeping all this in a private repository, it will be much better and safe.

11
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:51,370
Now, before we go to the third phase, if you would like to delete your stack, you can go ahead.

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:56,800
You can delete all the instances if you want, and we can provision it later by using the same playbooks.

13
00:00:57,580 --> 00:01:02,320
So you can delete all the instances, you can keep controller for a while and you can shut it down.

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,510
You can delete all the instances, terminate them.

15
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:07,000
Once that is done, you can go to VPC.

16
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,970
And you can delete your VPC will be very easy to delete your VPC.

17
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:15,080
But first you have to delete the Nat Gateway Force.

18
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:16,140
Delete the Nat Gateway.

19
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,380
Wait for some time once the status is deleted.

20
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,240
Release the elastic IP.

21
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,960
Can release the elastic IP.

22
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:26,480
Once that is done, you can just go to your VPC.

23
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,960
You select your VPC and you can say Delete VPC.

24
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:36,420
When you delete VPC, it will delete subnet, root table and everything that is associated with it,

25
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:37,910
not the NAT gateway.

26
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,930
So you have to delete the Nat Gateway first.

27
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,340
If you wish, you can clean all this and then you can continue in the third phase where you can run

28
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,050
the playbook, set up the stack once again and continue with the third face execution.

29
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,560
Okay, If you're done here, join me in the third phase.
