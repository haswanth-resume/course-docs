1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:02,560
So clone your source code.

2
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:09,790
Get clone.

3
00:00:11,390 --> 00:00:15,890
If you already have this clone, get into the Vpro file Project Repository directory.

4
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,440
And you should be in this branch.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:25,630
VP hyphen them.

6
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,710
Which we are already in.

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,290
Will update our application properties file.

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:41,600
We'll update the file with all the back end details.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:43,220
Let's open this file.

10
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,340
Starting with this endpoint.

11
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,240
Username and password, Admin and admin.

12
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:10,690
One, two, three.

13
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:13,030
That's the same username and password we have used.

14
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,410
When will provisioning this instance mem cache?

15
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:39,470
Bought one.

16
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:39,980
One, two, one.

17
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,880
That's fine.

18
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,230
Rabbit MQ.

19
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,260
MQ for that endpoint, just copy it.

20
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,820
What is five, six, seven one?

21
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,570
But we have to change.

22
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,300
Five, six, seven, one rabbit.

23
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:08,880
Q Username and password V hash.

24
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,970
We should already have this in the variables file.

25
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:18,390
Rabbit is the username, and that's the password.

26
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,930
So we have given all the details verified.

27
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:40,180
Once again, ideas, end point ideas, username, password, mem cache endpoint, port number rabbit

28
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,510
MQ Endpoint Port number Rabbit.

29
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:45,400
MQ User and password.

30
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,670
What's even quit.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,530
Let's go back to the project directory.

32
00:02:56,030 --> 00:03:03,980
Where we have the bombed out XML file and we're going to run an install which should generate our artifact.

33
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,950
We're really doing it from our command line.

34
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:15,120
But if you already have the CD pipeline, you can also generate artifact from Jenkins and deploy it

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,290
also over there from there automatically to bienstock stack environment.

36
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:22,380
But for now we'll just do it manually.

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,870
Upload target.

38
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,200
So Artifact is ready.

39
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:29,460
Let's upload this artifact to bin Stack.

40
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,930
Application versions.

41
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:43,590
Here, upload and deploy.

42
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,040
So let's upload the artifact from here.

43
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:55,700
Get into your project directory where we clone the source code and build the artifact and let's upload

44
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:58,370
the artifact v profile v two dot var.

45
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,190
And let's see.

46
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,890
Deploy.

47
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:05,760
Now wasn't label let's say we have this portion as.

48
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:11,950
V profile hyphen version five dot for anything.

49
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,420
I'm just giving for a sample.

50
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,700
Deploy and wait.

51
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,230
It will upload the artifact.

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:22,790
Okay.

53
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,070
After uploading, it looks good.

54
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:25,480
Let's click on the link.
