1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,070
First, we'll create a repository on GitHub and will make sure every code change that we make, we are

2
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:10,280
committing it and we are keeping track of every change.

3
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,460
So I will create a repository in my GitHub account.

4
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:16,640
I will name the repository as TerraForm.

5
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,290
Hyphen.

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:18,490
E.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,630
W s hyphen v profile.

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:23,430
In order to keep it safe.

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,760
You can make it private, but I'm keeping it public.

10
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,520
But remember, you have to make it private, because if you accidentally put the access key and secret

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,710
key, then you will not be exposed.

12
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:40,880
I'm going to keep it public because I am not going to store any access key over there.

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:44,930
Will later create the get ignored file as well.

14
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:45,740
Not now.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,720
So the first let's create the repository.

16
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, let's get.

17
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:00,610
The other and we'll open our intelligence and we'll code by using intelligence.

18
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,660
If you wish to use your own ID or VIM ed, your choice.

19
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:10,930
I'm going to use intelligence and I'm going to create a new project from a vision control.

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,910
So we'll give our what'll.

21
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,870
And select a location where you want to store your repository.

22
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,650
I'm good with that.

23
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:20,500
After five.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,160
You wanted in this window itself.

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:31,740
Let's make little change in the RMD file.

26
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:42,430
Called us to form code for V Profile project.

27
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,180
This should be fine.

28
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:49,370
Let's save and commit this.

29
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:08,850
To control key to commit control shift key to push it to our version control remote repository.

30
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,820
Install and set up terraform on your machine.

31
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,400
If you have not done it, then go to the TerraForm.

32
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,600
Introductory video where I have explained how to set up TerraForm and also likely do not store your

33
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,220
credentials in the source code.

34
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:29,090
Do use, configure and set your access key and secret key.

35
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,100
I already have TerraForm installed or Fusion TerraForm.

36
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,530
Zero dot 13.2.

37
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:41,120
Anything older than this.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,300
I do not recommend any older version of TerraForm will not have the right syntax for the variables what

39
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,640
we are showing in the project video.

40
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,120
So I installed TerraForm with Jocko installed TerraForm Command.

41
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,460
You can also do that in Windows Machine.

42
00:02:55,490 --> 00:03:02,150
In macOS you use Blue kiosk, install TerraForm and set up your credentials.

43
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,320
If we have this, we can do our next thing.
