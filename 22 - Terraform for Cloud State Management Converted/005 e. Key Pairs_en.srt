1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:00,940
Okay.

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:04,390
Once we have variable declared, let's set things in the same order.

3
00:00:05,570 --> 00:00:06,010
Key.

4
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:07,520
Let's generate the key.

5
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,670
As such hyphen kitchen.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,560
And I have to make sure I'm going to give it with this name or else I'm going to change the name in

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,760
the variable section.

8
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:27,730
Oops.

9
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:35,890
Just as he Jen I can give hyphen f just I'll just hit enter and now I will paste the name u profile

10
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:36,370
key.

11
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:42,840
And so I should have a private key and a public key with that name.

12
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:44,370
Let's match it.

13
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,970
Now we prove that the private can that's the public key, can see the keys over there.

14
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,430
But you really don't need to see the key.

15
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,480
It's fine.

16
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,180
Now, this is to create the key pair.

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:01:00,730
So let's first create the key pair.

18
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
How about that?

19
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,720
So let's create a new file to create a key pair.

20
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,390
I like distributing my resources into different, different file.

21
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:11,320
It makes it more readable, more accessible.

22
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:11,970
Right.

23
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,050
We can put everything in one file, all our code in one file, but it becomes difficult, cumbersome

24
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:18,160
to manage also.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,690
So key.

26
00:01:19,690 --> 00:01:21,700
Maybe just one single resource, but.

27
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,400
Distributing into different files makes more manageable because it keeps peers active.

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,240
So we have the TerraForm plugin install entirely.

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:35,580
And let's see its benefits now.

30
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,710
You see, I just type out s and I can hit tab and will complete the rest then.

31
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:46,210
What resource do you want to use?

32
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:49,790
It's already highlighting as s underscore key underscore pair.

33
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,000
Yeah.

34
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:55,950
And name of your resource V Profile key.

35
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,150
That was pretty convenient, right?

36
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,490
Also, key name.

37
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,870
And we can give you a key name.

38
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:07,250
We profile key.

39
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:11,980
So key will get created with this name on the plus account.

40
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:13,420
Public key.

41
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:14,620
We are not giving the content.

42
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,960
We are giving the function file.

43
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:26,190
And we're going to give that dot see that it's even highlighting or showing us our variable.

44
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,020
Public key part.

45
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:31,300
Yeah, in seconds.

46
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:32,590
I have written that.

47
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:33,870
So it's.

48
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:35,770
It's very easy, very convenient.

49
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,360
Okay, let's commit this.

50
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,970
And will give it a key.

51
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,250
Pierce.

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:43,540
Commit.

53
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,620
Message, commit.

54
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:47,070
Okay.

55
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:48,930
It's saying there's no error, but there is a warning.

56
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,110
Would you like to review that?

57
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,850
Let's see.

58
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,100
Court analysis.

59
00:02:54,620 --> 00:03:01,390
It's giving some warning in voir dire for let's check it by number six and ten II number six.

60
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,870
That warning is, I think, for the backward compatibility.

61
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,580
We can pass any argument or we can pass a string or list that should not be any problem.

62
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:14,020
Let's save this anyways and let's format it to see if it can fix.

63
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:17,390
Commit.

64
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:20,300
Let's push it.

65
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,470
Okay, let's try and execute that.

66
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:31,800
Faust will run TerraForm.

67
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,820
In it.

68
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,400
So install plugins, then we'll set TerraForm validate.

69
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,570
It's a success.

70
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,550
Let's try now.

71
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,510
TerraForm.

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,980
Format if that fixed that code analysis.

73
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:59,230
And didn't do anything in the vase, but it make changes in back end and keep SDF.

74
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,860
Basically it aligned everything properly.

75
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,130
Okay, that is good.

76
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:18,290
Let's also apply our state first, let's say plan.

77
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,030
You can check if you have any conflicting things we don't have.

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,260
We profile hyphen keys.

79
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:28,340
There were keys there, but still deleted because we don't need it anyways.

80
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:38,930
And now let's apply it.

81
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,520
Yes.

82
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:47,410
So that you'd have created the key.

83
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,490
Everything is validated.

84
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,050
Now let's begin writing code for VPC.
