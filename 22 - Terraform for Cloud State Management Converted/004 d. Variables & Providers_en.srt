1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:03,220
Next, we'll create the providers file.

2
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,360
Remember.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,650
And don't ask me.

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:18,380
Okay, so provider obviously has a region.

5
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,360
Var dot.

6
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:22,970
Underscore region, which is a variable.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,910
I'll just keep it as just region.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:33,460
So variable and we are going to create a variables file where we'll declare all our variables.

9
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,880
So let's create var start tf.

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,690
First, let's put the region variable US east to region.

11
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:51,850
We're using a underscore region will name it as a US underscore region in the providers file.

12
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,520
Make sure you're referring to the same name of the variable I have used underscore region and the same

13
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,720
variable I have defined.

14
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,480
Next, we'll define variable for our AMIS.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:06,190
So based on the region, it will pick up the right AMIS map variable.

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,320
And this army is going to be for the Bastion host.

17
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:15,440
We're going to launch also bastion host in our public subnet of our VPC.

18
00:01:15,980 --> 00:01:20,900
So based on what region we define, we have given three region you can give all the regions that you

19
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,330
use.

20
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:22,690
So we're going with Ubuntu.

21
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:25,100
Let's update that Amis.

22
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:28,910
Let's go to launch instance.

23
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:31,880
That's fine.

24
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:33,970
Ubuntu 21 to 20 should be good.

25
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,330
So let's pick up that.

26
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:42,730
Okay.

27
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,640
Other images.

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,510
I'm not updating.

29
00:01:44,510 --> 00:01:48,350
I'm just keeping it for dummy because anyways, I'm going to use the same region.

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:53,780
This region, if I change to other region, I'll give it us East one.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,680
Yeah.

32
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,810
Or about one or whatever region I'm using, then my code will fail because these are just dummy values.

33
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,320
But you find the right ID and put it into your variable.

34
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:11,610
Okay, we'll define other variable we're going to create of keys.

35
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,380
So we'll create variable names for them.

36
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:16,450
Private key part, Public key part.

37
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:18,710
And also the username.

38
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,910
So we'll create variable private underscore key underscore part its value we profile key.

39
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,880
So now we we're going to create key.

40
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:31,460
After this, we'll make sure we create the key with this name, the current directory and user we're

41
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,910
using open to because this is open to.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,650
So when the Bastion host gets created, we are going to provision it with few commands.

43
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:45,140
For that, we're going to use this key to log in private key file to login.

44
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:51,410
Public key file will be used when we're launching the instance or creating the key pair and also username

45
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:51,950
it will use.

46
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:57,290
And this key to login, we'll be also creating security group for our Bastion host.

47
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,020
So we'll give a variable for my IP.

48
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:04,730
So my IP variable there, which we'll be using in our security group Ingress rule.

49
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,370
We are also going to set up.

50
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:13,330
Amazon active MQ, which will be a replacement for a rabbit MQ.

51
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:21,460
So when we create a last or active MQ, we need to provide the username and password and these will

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,810
define it as variable.

53
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,110
So our MQ user and our MQ pass.

54
00:03:26,710 --> 00:03:29,620
You can wish and change a different password.

55
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:34,470
But make sure it's it's longer, more than 12 characters.

56
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,460
I'm going to make it much more bigger.

57
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,690
This is fine.

58
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:43,510
So we also create ideas.

59
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:50,470
And we'll have database username and password, which we're also going to use to log into our instance

60
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,960
and provision it with our schemas.

61
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,680
So we need the database username and password.

62
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,790
And again, we'll put them as variables so db pos variable and DB name variable.

63
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,380
And of course also we need to give the DB user variable.

64
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,790
So DB user variable, DB pass and DB name.

65
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,750
So account's going to be our database name for our V profile project.

66
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:17,100
One more variable instance count.

67
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,370
So if you want to launch any number of instances, we can just update this number and we can have many

68
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:23,730
instances.

69
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,470
We don't need to make change in our code.

70
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,780
VPC we are going to create.

71
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:34,320
So VPC, name and VPC name will name it as we profile hyphen VPC.

72
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,610
We're going to create six subnets in three different zones, three public subnet and three private subnets.

73
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:43,560
So we're going to give the zone name.

74
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,900
So zone want us east to a zone two us is to be zone three US east to sea.

75
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,700
So three zones there.

76
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,730
Idea.

77
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:02,270
We'll keep it as one 72.20 1.0.0 last 16.

78
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:07,370
And in this, we're going to create we're going to slice it with three public and three private subnets

79
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:08,660
or total six subnets.

80
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,610
So we'll give their range as well.

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:14,530
Okay, so public subnet one CIDR.

82
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:23,080
Public subnet two CIDR Public subnet three CIDR public subnet sorry Private subnet one CIDR And it's

83
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,060
just in a same order.

84
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,080
1.02.03.04.0.

85
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,010
Then private subnet 35.0 sorry two.

86
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:34,840
Private subnet 25.0.

87
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,240
Private subnet 36.022.

88
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:44,350
So total six subnet in the VPC and we are not going to mention the CIDR in the script.

89
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,300
We are going to put everything as variable.

90
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:52,930
It may take initially a lot of time to declare variables for you and could be cumbersome, but it's

91
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:55,270
going to save you a lot of time later.

92
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:00,880
Most importantly, it will make your code reusable so you can just you can use the same code for a different

93
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:01,350
project.

94
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,810
You just change the value of the variables based on the requirement, like name of the VPC, CIDR range,

95
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:12,640
key login key zones, regions, database usernames and password.

96
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,330
You can change them, tweak them and use it for the other project.

97
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:17,780
Okay.

98
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,340
Intel AG is saying that it supports plugins for dot file.

99
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,510
Let's say install plugin.

100
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:24,500
Let's try that.

101
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,620
Okay.

102
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,810
And we getting nice logos also there right in that TerraForm logo and it's going to read our code properly

103
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,320
now.

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,670
Proper formatting.

105
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:45,710
This is good.
