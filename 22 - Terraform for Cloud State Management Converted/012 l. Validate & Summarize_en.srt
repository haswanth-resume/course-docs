1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:07,050
So we get our artifact uploaded and application is running.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:07,440
Fine.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,030
Let's make a test admin, underscore VPI password admin.

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:13,290
Underscore VPI.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,600
If you're able to log in, the database is verified the database connection.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,940
So we're able to login ideas, connection is verified and let's check rabbit MQ.

7
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:27,760
Who initiated this is also good.

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:30,870
Let's check Mom, cash all users.

9
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:33,010
Let's pick up a user.

10
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,640
Data is inserted in cash.

11
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,410
This is good.

12
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:38,150
Go back.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,160
Let's click the user once again.

14
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,080
Data is from cash, so cash is also verified.

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:50,330
So that completes our test and also our project.

16
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,730
So really intense work there.

17
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,930
If you have come this far, you have done a great job and you have gained a real and rich experience

18
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:04,190
in automating a cloud infrastructure with TerraForm.

19
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:11,300
Complete VPC stack we have set up with TerraForm and we have created our application stack on that VPC.

20
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:19,040
So all the score and you say, just terraform apply and everything gets created automatically.

21
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,480
One final thing before I close this.

22
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:27,920
If you are doing it in parts this project, if you're taking few days to complete it, then your public

23
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,970
IP may change.

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:32,570
So you would like to update your public IP in the variables file.

25
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:38,420
Or if you just want to keep it simple, you can just say 0.0.0 slash.

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,020
Zero.

27
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,580
So for the Bastion host is going to use this as your public IP.

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,120
That means it will allow a search connection from anywhere.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,520
Or you can keep updating it on daily basis while you're doing your project.

30
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,100
So yes, we have created the entire V profile stack VPC stack by using TerraForm.

31
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,770
We set up the entire PC.

32
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,770
With Bastion host.

33
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:13,060
And then we have created our V profile stack in that VPC.

34
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,400
So that should be all in this project video.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,320
Thank you very much for doing it.

36
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,370
Completing it.

37
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,410
I will see you in the next one.
