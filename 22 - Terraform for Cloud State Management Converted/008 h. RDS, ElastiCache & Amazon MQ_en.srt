1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:03,290
All right.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,820
So we have security group ready now.

3
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:08,270
It's time to set up our back end services ideas.

4
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,610
Elastic cache Active MQ.

5
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,860
So let's create a new file.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,180
Mm.

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,360
Back and hyphen services.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,430
Dr..

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,050
Okay ideas.

10
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,810
We also need to create ideas.

11
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,430
DB Subnet Group.

12
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,880
DB Subnet group is simply collection of the subnets.

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,010
So we'll use the resource.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:47,790
So the underscore db underscore subnet group that is the resource.

15
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,950
And let's give a name of proof.

16
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,640
We proof.

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:58,290
We profile hyphen, rdx, hyphen, subgroup.

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:02,360
Subnets are subnet, i.e. the list of subnet ID.

19
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:04,940
Let's give a name also to it.

20
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,880
I'll give a name as.

21
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,870
I just simply mean.

22
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:14,600
List of subnet IDs.

23
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:15,350
So.

24
00:01:16,290 --> 00:01:18,360
Subnet is created through the VPC.

25
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:23,160
So we have module dot, VPC, dot.

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:24,900
This should be private.

27
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,600
Let's see this list.

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,030
Private subnet ID.

29
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:34,510
There is no ID, but this private subnet there.

30
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:38,340
Private subnets subnet.

31
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:42,390
So that is supposed to be a list.

32
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,140
So the first element in the list will get the first private subnet ID from there.

33
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:53,710
Comma.

34
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,180
Module.

35
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,400
Dot VPC.

36
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,510
Dr. Private subnets.

37
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:03,490
One.

38
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,410
Module.

39
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,960
Okay, so three private subnet IDs.

40
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:16,820
Our ideas will be in this subnet group, which is part of three subnet ID or collection of three subnet

41
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:17,300
ID.

42
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,020
That should be it.

43
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,290
Let's give some tags.

44
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,700
This is fine.

45
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,420
Okay, before we write the results for the ideas, we have also elastic cash and elastic cash.

46
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,730
Also, there is a subnet group.

47
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,080
Resource.

48
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,240
E w.

49
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,410
S underscore elastic.

50
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:41,050
Cash is elastic.

51
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,920
Cash.

52
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,530
Elastic cash.

53
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,450
Subnet group.

54
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:52,190
In the resources we profile have an e cache fund subgroup.

55
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:53,710
Name.

56
00:02:55,550 --> 00:03:00,770
Seem subnet IDs will take the same ones we did over here.

57
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,960
Okay, so tag, that should be fine.

58
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:24,020
So our subnet glue for ideas and a subnet group for elastic cache.

59
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,210
Now let's create our ideas.

60
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,240
So resource e.

61
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,520
W.

62
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:29,730
S.

63
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,590
Underscore d.

64
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:31,310
B.

65
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:33,570
Underscore instance.

66
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,280
And you limit us.

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,710
We profile hyphen radius.

68
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:48,520
Now these are the options attributes I'm going to use allocated storage 20 GB storage type GB two engine.

69
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:52,090
My SQL engine version 5.6.34.

70
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:54,800
Instance class DB2 micro.

71
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,200
Be careful at this part.

72
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:58,150
Name.

73
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,450
That dot db name.

74
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,100
This variable we have defined in the variables file.

75
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,010
And their variables file.

76
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,180
That DB name, DB user and DB pass.

77
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:15,840
Yeah.

78
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,880
So user name and password.

79
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:23,850
Parameter group name have taken the default parameter group multi.

80
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,270
I'm saying false, but if you want high availability then make sure you do.

81
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:28,630
True.

82
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:32,320
So you'll have one primary, one secondary public accessibility.

83
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,090
No, we don't want public accessibility.

84
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:41,320
So false because Beanstalk instance is going to access this IDs so we don't need to make it publicly

85
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,100
accessible.

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:46,820
This option will save you some money when you're practicing.

87
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:48,040
Skip Final snapshot.

88
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,600
True.

89
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,350
When you practice rides.

90
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,010
Now, I learned that hard way when I was doing TerraForm.

91
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,010
I was learning TerraForm and I was experimenting with ideas.

92
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,190
So I end up having a lot of snapshots because when it was deleting the snare ideas, it was keeping

93
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,210
the snapshot.

94
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,280
And I did it like many times.

95
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,140
So I had like many, many snapshots.

96
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:11,590
So keep this option true.

97
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,090
So it will also delete the snapshot.

98
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:17,560
It will not take the snapshot when the IDs is getting deleted.

99
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:23,030
This is good for learning purpose when you're experimenting, but really not good for production use

100
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,600
case.

101
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,810
You should have a snapshot if you're deleting any idea.

102
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,180
So in case you want to recover, you can recover from that.

103
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,310
The DB subnet group.

104
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,370
So the DB subnet group that we created previously.

105
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,120
There.

106
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:46,980
So you have to give a dot name, not the ID db subnet group name, that's the attribute.

107
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:53,640
So to give the name of the DB subnet group, not its ID VPC, it's part of our VPC VPC security group.

108
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,930
And so we already have created VPC Security Group.

109
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,320
They're right.

110
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:06,860
Security Group V Profile hyphen Backend hyphen s G.

111
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:12,350
Okay, so that was about ideas.

112
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,990
Now, elastic cache.

113
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,420
So the resource name is E.

114
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:19,700
S underscore Elastic cash.

115
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,040
Elastic cash.

116
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,880
Underscore cluster, but really will not have really a cluster, just one single node.

117
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,870
We're going to do name it as V profile hyphen cache.

118
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,180
Let's give the same name for the cluster.

119
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:37,380
Right.

120
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,940
We profile hyphen cache.

121
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:46,520
Engine, so it supports mem cache and will have mem cache.

122
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:47,550
And.

123
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:50,770
Okay.

124
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:54,720
No type casualty to micro number of caching node one.

125
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:58,440
Make sure you give this one, otherwise you'll have multiples.

126
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,860
Parameter group name is the default parameter group.

127
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,170
You can find that from a plus documentation.

128
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,450
Port number 11211.

129
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:08,190
Security Group ID.

130
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:14,460
The security group that you already created, you profile back end g same we have given for the IDS

131
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:18,720
subnet group name again name not the ID.

132
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,110
So the subnet group that we created for elastic cache.

133
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,900
That's pretty long path, right?

134
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,860
But now at least you don't have to type it.

135
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:33,170
You can just type and, you know, it's just going to complete the rest of it.

136
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:34,450
Okay.

137
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:35,130
Now.

138
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:39,180
Active mq so the resource is.

139
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:43,760
Underscore m q underscore broker.

140
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:44,910
Wow.

141
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,520
That has given like all the options.

142
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,270
Nice.

143
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:50,480
You know, Yes.

144
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,570
I sometimes say it's easier than, you know, copy paste.

145
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,310
Okay, so the broker name, That's the broker name I'm giving.

146
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,350
Same as the resource name.

147
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,330
Engine type active MQ.

148
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,420
Engine version 5.15 point zero.

149
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:13,240
Host instance type mkt TX two dot Micro Security Group again the back end security group Subnet ID.

150
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,990
Now we don't have the subnet group concept over here.

151
00:08:16,990 --> 00:08:18,780
We just have to give the subnet IDs.

152
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:26,290
So subnet IDs, it's a list so you can give we just creating one single instance, not a cluster.

153
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,730
So one subnet id should be fine and private subnet ID of course.

154
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,340
Username and password.

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,600
The user that you want to create value rabbit MQ user that is again coming from.

156
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,830
The variables Rabbit, MQ, user rabbit, rabbit and queue password.

157
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,970
This is the password.

158
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,080
All right.

159
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,300
So when you're building your application, you know you have access to the variables file, right?

160
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:52,420
Application properties, file for a V profile.

161
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,970
You can update with all these details.

162
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,770
I think we are good with the back end.

163
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:05,200
Let's commit it back end services.

164
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,280
And I would also like to push it now.
