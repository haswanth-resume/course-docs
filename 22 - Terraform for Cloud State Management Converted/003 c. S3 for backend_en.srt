1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:01,940
We'll create a file.

2
00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:07,850
Call us back and.

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,690
S 3.2.

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,300
Added to the gate?

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:23,020
Yes.

6
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:29,610
In this file, we mention the S3 bucket where we're going to store the state of our terraform of our

7
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,750
cloud infrastructure.

8
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,700
So as we're going to maintain our state back and state in three buckets, so let's create a three bucket.

9
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:39,670
Let's go to a three.

10
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,500
And I'm going to create a bucket named as Terra form.

11
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,730
Or I'll just say Terra.

12
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:56,100
For the wi fi hyphen state and I'll give some number just to make it unique.

13
00:00:57,270 --> 00:00:57,440
Okay.

14
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,300
I'm going to use the region.

15
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,270
Ohio.

16
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:03,970
US East.

17
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:10,760
You can wish any Univision choose any region, but make sure it has minimum three zones, because we're

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:17,480
going to create VPC zones into three three zones, three subnets into three different zones.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,670
So I'll select Ohio.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,210
There.

21
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,650
Let's get into our pocket and let's create a directory of folder.

22
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:31,880
We'll name it as just terraform.

23
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,620
We'll put this information.

24
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,610
In their back end.

25
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,590
State files a form.

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,860
Backend is a three.

27
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:08,180
Now TerraForm supports multiple backend services like you can also use console if you want.

28
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,880
So we're going with SX three, that's our bucket name.

29
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,860
So mention your bucket name, water bucket.

30
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:19,580
You created key the directory that you created in that S3 bucket and a file name which will maintain

31
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,020
the state region.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:23,300
I'm using us east to Ohio.

33
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,840
Feel free to use any other region if you want.

34
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,170
With that, we'll first initialize.

35
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,150
To reform.

36
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:34,610
So we have to just say terraform it.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:39,120
Let's open our git bash, which is pretty easy to use.

38
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,270
Okay, so I'm in the directory where we are creating our TerraForm scripts.

39
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:49,700
I'm going to say TerraForm in it.

40
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:55,510
I had deleted the user.

41
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,530
So I have set the access key once again and I'm doing TerraForm in it.

42
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,380
OC successfully configured the back end SX three.
