1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:06,920
Now we can write VPC code as normally fetching the resource from the documentation, mentioning VPC

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:12,320
details, subnet details, route tables, NAT Gateway, Internet Gateway.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,750
We can write all the resources one by one and plug in, connect all them together.

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:24,470
Also, there's one very easy way you can use TerraForm Registry and you can find modules.

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:32,540
Modules are readymade packages if you want to set up VPC, complete VPC with Internet Gateway, routable

6
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:37,790
subnets, Internet Gateway, all of that, it can be done very easily.

7
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:42,790
So you can come to the TerraForm Registry and you can search for a module like we want to set up VPC

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,450
so we can search VPC.

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,350
That's search.

10
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,640
So it's in this house and this is official that is called as official.

11
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:54,970
It's official module repository.

12
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:01,660
You have their VPC and you have for security group, also X ideas and many more.

13
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:03,670
So let's select this VPC.

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:07,040
So how to use this?

15
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,580
There'll be some information about what all you can do with this module.

16
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,730
But the easiest way is to check the examples.

17
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:15,830
Example Complete VPC.

18
00:01:16,220 --> 00:01:17,360
Okay, let's check that.

19
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,880
And there will be a GitHub link with example.

20
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,470
So let's click on that.

21
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,020
So here you have complete VPC and this main dot of output.

22
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:31,400
Dot.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,400
Let's see.

24
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,820
Main dot.

25
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,330
Okay, so you have to mention provider, which we already have mentioned.

26
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:40,500
Security group.

27
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,850
You can create like this by giving an VPC ID.

28
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,340
The BBC that we're going to create from module but.

29
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,110
Then we have the actual module thing.

30
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,250
So module.

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,080
VPC.

32
00:01:54,380 --> 00:02:02,030
And then in this you can mention name of VPC CIDR availability zones in a list format.

33
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:07,460
So all the availability zones, private subnets, public subnets, or you can create other subnets,

34
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,870
for example, like this.

35
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:13,400
If you want to enable DNS hostname if you want to have a nat gateway.

36
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,620
Our VP in Gateway DSP Options set.

37
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,350
And evil is three end point.

38
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,230
And so all those options are there.

39
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:26,110
You just have to give the values and your VPC will be created.

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,490
All right.

41
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,040
And we're going to use this way to create VPC.

42
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,870
And this is these are through modules.

43
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:37,240
So when you do when you mention this and when you run TerraForm in it, it will download these modules.

44
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,010
So let's go to our ID and let's create a new file.

45
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,730
We'll say VPC, dot, d, F.

46
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,610
So I'm going to say module.

47
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,190
In double quotes.

48
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:56,090
I'll give the model name.

49
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,930
VPC.

50
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,960
The important part is this.

51
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:02,740
Source.

52
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,230
Equal to.

53
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,270
Okay.

54
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,010
So that's the part we are saying, you know, download it from here.

55
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:14,110
There's a VPC section.

56
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:17,440
So that's going to be the source, but it's not yet available locally.

57
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,340
So ID is also Intel is also giving us, you know, the error.

58
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,290
I can't locate this module locally.

59
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:28,470
But when we say terraform in it, all these modules will be downloaded.

60
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,670
So let's give other details.

61
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,800
Name and CIDR that we are taking from the variables file, which we have already defined.

62
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,740
BBC name.

63
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,160
And the basic idea.

64
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,850
Availability zones is.

65
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,490
Private subnet list.

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,320
Public service list.

67
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:00,550
We also need an ad gateway so you will not get with true.

68
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:08,090
But if you have multiple subnets so it will create multiple NAD gateway, that could be very expensive

69
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,290
for our exercise.

70
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,720
So we'll just say single net gateway.

71
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,560
Also enabling DNS host names and DNS support.

72
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,260
And also, let's give some tag.

73
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,730
So that's those tags are really very general properties or attribute, but we can also have VPC tags.

74
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:27,960
Right.

75
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,340
Okay.

76
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:34,600
So that simple code that is like, what, 22 lines of code that will create our entire VPC stack with

77
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,900
three public subnets, three private subnet, three public subnet distributed in three different zones.

78
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,390
Also having the NAT gateway.

79
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,180
An internet gateway will anyways get created because we have the public subnet.

80
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,110
We have not.

81
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,700
We are not mentioning the drought tables.

82
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:55,020
It will also create route tables automatically and link our subnets as well.

83
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,740
Let's commit this.

84
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,340
We can ignore that.

85
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,420
Let's commit.

86
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,240
Control shift key.

87
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,530
Let's push.

88
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,900
And let's test it.

89
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:22,580
So we have included a new module, so we have to set TerraForm in it.

90
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,290
So you see it's downloading.

91
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:30,680
And it's keeping it in this location.

92
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,080
Okay, so we have the modules.

93
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:35,810
Let's check in our ID.

94
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:38,060
You see that that warning is gone now?

95
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:39,110
Yeah.

96
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,290
You know, let's now test something, right?

97
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,820
Let's say enable.

98
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,330
I would like to enable the three end point if you want.

99
00:05:49,350 --> 00:05:49,830
Okay.

100
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,330
It's just showing you an option.

101
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:56,310
You see now it's clearly showing you right now if you want to already highlight all the things, you

102
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:03,600
know, just type there, you know, initially model VPC, give the curly braces and run terraform in

103
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:03,720
it.

104
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,600
So, you know, you can easily find all the options.

105
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,030
You don't need to go through the documentation also.

106
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:11,490
Time to test.

107
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,930
TerraForm validate.

108
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:20,440
That's a success TerraForm format.

109
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,140
TerraForm Plan.

110
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,070
Okay, So with that 22 line of code, it's going to add 20 resources.

111
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,960
That's amazing.

112
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,280
Fine.

113
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:38,030
I'm going to set TerraForm apply to set up my entire VPC now.

114
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:40,340
Right.

115
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:46,080
So it's creating elastic IP, VPC, elastic IP attaching to the nat Gateway.

116
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:54,630
Roundtable subnets associating roundtable with the subnets.

117
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:57,570
Okay.

118
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:59,400
Now, Gateway, that's going to take some time.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,920
Okay, that is done.

120
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:08,840
We can check it in our account plus account.

121
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,300
Let's go to VPC.

122
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,610
We should see the VPC.

123
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,830
There we profile VPC subnets.

124
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:28,240
We see all our subnets, public and private subnets round table, of course.

125
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,500
My private round table.

126
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,050
You have the routing, tree routing to the Internet gateway.

127
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,180
Now, that's default.

128
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,700
Wait.

129
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,930
Yeah, that one.

130
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:37,440
Yeah.

131
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,690
And that's private.

132
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,500
Can see the subnet association.

133
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:41,780
Right.

134
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,520
All that we just 22 line of code.

135
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,450
All right.

136
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,410
That's brilliant.

137
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,290
Okay, now we have the VP running.

138
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,370
Now we can set up our stack, but we also need to have security group.

139
00:07:54,370 --> 00:08:01,570
So we need we're going to set up backend services as we discussed in architectural design ideas, active

140
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:03,460
queue, elastic cache.

141
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:05,990
Front end.

142
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,130
We're going to use beans tax.

143
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,850
We need security group for beans stack and back in services security group.

144
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:17,000
We'll have load balancer we need load balancer security group also the bastion host not to mention we

145
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,770
are going going to create bastion Host so we are going to need security group for the bastion host as

146
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,280
well.
