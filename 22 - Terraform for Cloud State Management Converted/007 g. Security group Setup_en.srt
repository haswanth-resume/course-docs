1
00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:01,800
So let's create.

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:04,790
Resources for the security group.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,460
So name it as crap.

4
00:00:09,610 --> 00:00:11,200
Dot tx f.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,460
Okay, so resource.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:20,020
Underscore security group.

7
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:26,570
And the name forced the security group for being stack load balancer.

8
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:28,820
I'll keep that name.

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:30,900
Okay.

10
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:33,310
Name will be this description.

11
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:34,720
Some description you can give.

12
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:40,870
Now security group has to be part of a VPC, so we have to give the VPC ID, VPC ID.

13
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,120
Our VPC is created by module.

14
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:47,710
And so its path is module dot VPC.

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,450
And we need the ID of the VPC, but we don't know as long as it doesn't return the value.

16
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,390
So what could be the attribute or the data source?

17
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:59,960
We can find the output from the module documentation itself.

18
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:01,060
You can see output.

19
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:06,640
So these are the things that it returns like aces and so many other things, so we can just search for

20
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:06,940
it.

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,300
It would be a lot of IDs.

22
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,910
I think we with VPC underscore ID.

23
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:18,130
So this description, the idea of the VPC are default VPC ID.

24
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,710
So we have two things VPC underscore ID or default, underscore VP, underscore ID.

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,710
We can use both.

26
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,450
But we just need to use any one.

27
00:01:25,450 --> 00:01:27,580
So we'll just go with VPC underscore ID.

28
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,160
So I'll say module dart, vpc, dart VPC, underscore ID.

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,820
Okay, so we have a grace rule.

30
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,120
Right.

31
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:45,430
So I'm just, you know, just typing and hitting tab.

32
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:45,790
That's it.

33
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:46,900
It's just completing.

34
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,550
Yeah.

35
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,470
So outbound rule.

36
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,810
I'm going to say protocol.

37
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,930
When you say minus one, it means all the protocol and.

38
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:00,300
I'm going to give the CIDR block.

39
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,770
0.0.0.

40
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:09,360
0.0.0.0.

41
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,500
Slash zero.

42
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,790
So I'm saying all the outbound traffic is allowed to go anywhere in Greece.

43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,980
This is the load balancer security group.

44
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,440
So and we're going to allow the connection on 80.

45
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,720
80.

46
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:25,100
And the protocol.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:29,300
I'm going to use a TCP CIDR block.

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,840
So inbound traffic, 80 allowed from anywhere.

49
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,250
Okay.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,870
That should be two rules.

51
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,520
Inbound and outbound.

52
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,960
Now security group for the Bastion host We are also going to launch a bastion host.

53
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,150
So the resource.

54
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,480
Head of the security group.

55
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,070
Let's give a name.

56
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,310
That is the name I'm giving the profile.

57
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,140
Hyphen Bastion hyphen Security Group.

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,720
Name of the security group.

59
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,800
Some description.

60
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,510
And it belongs to this particular VPC ID.

61
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:06,330
Okay.

62
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,370
This is a new is going to return a string.

63
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:08,630
Okay.

64
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,650
I need to remove these double codes.

65
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:11,550
Of course.

66
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,360
Yeah, that is right.

67
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:15,690
Yeah.

68
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,800
So it was not highlighting because there was double quotes.

69
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:17,980
Right.

70
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:25,300
So we can just say module dot the VPC dot and you can list all the attributes, all the output here

71
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:25,720
itself.

72
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:29,680
You don't even need to go the documentation VPC, ID.

73
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:35,160
Okay.

74
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,010
So the ingress and ingress rule.

75
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:45,710
Outbound again, traffic allow for all protocol to go anywhere.

76
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:52,430
Ingress.

77
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,640
So this security group for Bastion hosts, we have to be very careful in ingress.

78
00:03:57,650 --> 00:03:57,850
Right.

79
00:03:57,860 --> 00:04:00,410
I'm only going to allow 22.

80
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,540
PCP.

81
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:13,730
Only from my IP, and I have already declared variable for my IP and I'm going to use that var dot my

82
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:14,330
IP.

83
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,790
So to security group down there.

84
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:26,630
Load balancer security group Bastion host security group now security group for our EC2 instance, which

85
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:29,800
will be part of our bienstock environment.

86
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,610
We'll create security group for that.

87
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,080
Now, yes, I know if you're thinking that when we create bienstock, it will create its own security

88
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,320
group.

89
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,010
Yes, that's true.

90
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,950
But you know, it allows 22 from anywhere.

91
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,250
Plus we have to check then all the information from the output.

92
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:43,760
Right.

93
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,790
How about like we have a complete control over it?

94
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,540
Yes.

95
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,990
And I think you should have as much as control on the security as you have on the infrastructure.

96
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:02,050
Okay, let's create then security group, for instance, in our bienstock environment.

97
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:08,580
Okay, Again, I'm saying egress, outbound rule.

98
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:10,530
All traffic can go anywhere.

99
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:13,290
I'm going to give now in grace rule.

100
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:19,170
And I would like to do a search to this beanstalk instance, but this will be part of private subnet,

101
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,650
so we cannot access it from the public network.

102
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:24,420
We can access it from the Bastion.

103
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:25,080
Host.

104
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,980
Bastion host will be the part of the security group that we just created over here, this and this resource

105
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,580
block.

106
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,900
So 22 allowed from my IP, we can do access to the Bastion host and from there we'll do a search to.

107
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,440
Instance, which is in the beanstalk.

108
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,250
So I have I'm going to give the rule in ingress.

109
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:50,580
Put 22.

110
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:01,030
And I want the access from the beans from from the Bastion host security group.

111
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,720
So I'm going to say security groups.

112
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,540
So I need to give ID from here.

113
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:11,640
A underscore Security group dot v Profile hyphen chain hyphen g.

114
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,420
Group dot E profile.

115
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,130
Hyphen.

116
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:20,890
Bastion hyphen 6.1..

117
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,110
Dot ID?

118
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,460
Yes.

119
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:29,550
So only the private connection gets it done.

120
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:35,430
Only the private connection from the Bastion host security group is allowed to the security group on

121
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:36,360
Port 22.

122
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:41,540
So we're keeping tight control on the security groups.

123
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:42,330
Okay.

124
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:46,610
One last security group for back end services ideas Elastic cash active MQ.

125
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,790
New security group.

126
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,100
It should be good.

127
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,950
That name we profile happened back in hyphen SG.

128
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,760
That's name.

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,320
I'll give some description.

130
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:01,980
There's a security group for IDS, active MQ and elastic cache.

131
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,230
And it belongs to the VPC.

132
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,900
ID just copy it from here.

133
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,150
You know, it's really, really sometimes faster to type by using this TerraForm plugins than copy pasting.

134
00:07:18,710 --> 00:07:19,760
Outbound rule.

135
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,070
Should be fine.

136
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,380
Inbound rule, though.

137
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:35,990
So I'm going to see all the port, all the protocol allowed from the security group.

138
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,770
So the beanstalk instance is going to access these backend services.

139
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:43,340
So we are going to see a security group dot.

140
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:46,910
V profile Prot sg.

141
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,830
That one.

142
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,190
Dot ID.

143
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:57,400
That is the security group of our being stag instance.

144
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,670
Okay, so we're done creating all the security groups resources, but these instances, ideas, active

145
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,860
and elastic, they'll be interacting with each other.

146
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:20,230
So I want to allow all traffic from its own security group ID, but if it's not created, we can't give

147
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:24,370
the security group ID, but we have another resource to do that.

148
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:32,500
And the resources security group underscore rule so we can update.

149
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,400
The security group rule with this resource.

150
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:41,400
So a type ingress I'm updating the ingress rule of.

151
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:50,670
The security group, Baghdad Security group from two all poured some 0 to 65005 35.

152
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:56,160
All the ports TCP ports security group ID the security.

153
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:59,910
The idea of the security group that you want to update that you want to add the rules.

154
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,370
Source security group ID from which security group ID you want to allow the connection.

155
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:12,960
So again, same security group ID So I want to allow all connection to its own security group ID and

156
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:13,850
that's it.

157
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:20,940
I think that should be the toughest part in this entire stack because this, like so many port numbers,

158
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,890
protocol, ingress, egress.

159
00:09:22,890 --> 00:09:23,400
Right.

160
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:30,180
But if you have experience setting up this stack manually, as we did in the project ID plus refactoring,

161
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:33,150
so you should be able to follow it very well.

162
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,210
It's the same thing, what are doing.

163
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:39,890
But we are automating and we are maintaining everything through a file state file.

164
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,740
Let's commit it.

165
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:53,450
And if you're going to see a security group, I'm trying to keep the commit messages very small just

166
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,330
to save some time.

167
00:09:54,330 --> 00:09:57,960
But now you should have better commit messages.

168
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:01,540
Okay.

169
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,890
Let's test it.

170
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:10,390
First we're going to say TerraForm Validate, or did we include a new module?

171
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:13,850
We did not, but let's just see TerraForm in it.

172
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:15,460
Okay, this is good.

173
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,290
It's just using existing things.

174
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,010
So terraform a validate, which will validate our syntax.

175
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,920
So that X is coming because I'm just using the tab.

176
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:25,250
Right.

177
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:29,000
But it's not required that a form format.

178
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,270
Yes, all the security group should be formatted very well now.

179
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,730
All the rules, equal tools, everything.

180
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:36,800
Please, properly.

181
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,430
This is good.

182
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,190
This is good.

183
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:40,060
Okay.

184
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,370
When that happens, I would like to also committed.

185
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:46,410
Yeah.

186
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:46,890
Good.

187
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,560
TerraForm Plan.

188
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:57,520
So we already have the VPC, so it's just refreshing.

189
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,450
It's checking.

190
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,700
Is the VPC in the same state as defined in our resources file?

191
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,320
If it's same, it's not going to do anything to the VPC or any resources to it.

192
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,390
Refreshing.

193
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:11,950
Seems everything nice.

194
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,280
But five things to be added, and those five things are of security group.

195
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:24,050
For security group and one update on the security group.

196
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,720
Yeah, we are good with this TerraForm apply.

197
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,920
I'm going to say yes.

198
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,750
That is done.
