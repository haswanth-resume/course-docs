1
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,070
In third phase.

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,420
Now we have the stack ready.

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:05,930
VPC stack is there.

4
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:07,750
All the instances are up and running.

5
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:09,190
We have the controller.

6
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:17,350
Third phase is all about doing search to all these instances and doing the execution, installing packages

7
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:20,110
and running all the operating system commands.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:26,800
It's not possible to controller to do a search to this instance because they are in a different VPC.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:28,020
They are in the file.

10
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,580
VPC Air controller is in default VPC.

11
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:33,560
The controller is in default VPC.

12
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:39,380
All the instances are in the profile VPC and they're in private subnet, so you cannot access it from

13
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:40,190
the outside world.

14
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:45,740
One way is you can do VPC peering and that will be fine when you do the execution first time.

15
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:51,560
But if you want to do a regular execution, you need to have your controller in the Vpro file VPC.

16
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:57,110
What you can do is you can use the Bastion host as a controller, you can install Ansible there, you

17
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:02,090
can install BOTO and pull your clone your playbooks and execute it from there.

18
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,500
That's one way.

19
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,940
And that will be also convenient, right?

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,270
Just directly to access to Bastion host.

21
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:15,330
Run the Ansible setup, set up the IAM role and execute playbooks from there.

22
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:16,980
But.

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:24,390
If that is more confusing to you, The easiest solution is you can create an army of controller and

24
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:28,980
launch the instance from that army into V profile VPC.

25
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:30,930
That will be much easier.

26
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,150
So your controller will be just like a bastion host in the public subnet so you can access it.

27
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,310
And then from there you can execute your playbook.

28
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:40,340
So I'm going to do that.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm going to create an EMI.

30
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:49,940
Image Create image, image of controller and limitless controller.

31
00:01:51,190 --> 00:01:51,940
EMI.

32
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:54,900
And see create image.

33
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,730
So am I is getting created.

34
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,990
It's going to take some time.

35
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,120
Now, very important point to note over here, If you're doing this in the project in a real time environment,

36
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,690
then remember when you are going to launch your controller.

37
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,580
In your secure VPC, then it will be just like the Bastion host.

38
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,250
So as I talked about the Bastion host.

39
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:24,050
It should be stable, safe and secure.

40
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:31,970
Same applies then to our controller machine also, and it will be much better if we use a hardened army

41
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,890
from Amazon marketplace.

42
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:34,640
Like from.

43
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,480
Center of internet security or any other army.

44
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,710
The hardened army that you prefer.

45
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,890
You better go with an hardened army.

46
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,820
So it becomes very difficult to exploit your controller machine.

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:50,000
If you want to try any hardened army, you can do that.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,460
But let me tell you, it's not going to be free.

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:54,900
There are charges for the hardened armies.

50
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,940
We have seen that.

51
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,770
So for the project exercises that you're are doing, you can keep it as we are doing.

52
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,520
But in a project, make sure you take a hardened army.

53
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,310
Okay.

54
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:09,090
So am I still is available now I can launch it.

55
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:18,810
So I'll go with PT to Micro and I'm going to select a VPC that we created and we're going to select

56
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,130
a public subnet.

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:22,590
We can select public subnet two.

58
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,230
We already have Bastion host in public Subnet one.

59
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,460
And that should be it.

60
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:27,880
Let's go.

61
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,480
Next.

62
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:37,860
Will give a name as v profile hyphen controller.

63
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:41,340
Security group.

64
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:45,030
I'm going to put it in the same security group as the Bastion host security group.

65
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,730
So we can do a search to Bastion host so we can do a search to the controller.

66
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,580
Host also.

67
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,540
Also.

68
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:59,920
Our V Profile Stack Security group allows 22 access from Bastion hosts, so it makes sense to use Bastion

69
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:00,850
host security group.

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,210
Let's launch.

71
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,530
Will keep the same login key.

72
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,850
So once our v profile controller is up in the VPC.

73
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,370
And we profile VPC.

74
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:16,290
It got created.

75
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:23,730
Now we don't need this controller, the older one, so we can just delete that dominated action instance

76
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,420
state.

77
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,370
Dominate.

78
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,590
We get the IP of a new controller.

79
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,290
And let's make a login.

80
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:37,500
Yeah.

81
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,400
Let's log in.

82
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,580
Now, remember, this is the exact clone of our previous controller.

83
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:48,110
There is very less difference apart from its being it being in a different network in a V profile VPC.

84
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,190
Okay.

85
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,480
Everything is up to date.

86
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,840
You can make a login test from here.

87
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,760
We'll log into one of the instance.

88
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,280
From our V profile stack, we have the login key.

89
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,030
Can use that login key as a I find I log in key and we need to get the IP.

90
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,490
Private IP.

91
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:18,790
Username.

92
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,270
They are all ubuntu so you should.

93
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,790
Username should be ubuntu.

94
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:23,520
And.

95
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,630
Yes, we are able to log in.

96
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:27,490
That's awesome.

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,130
Log out.
