1
00:00:01,940 --> 00:00:02,180
Okay.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:09,110
Our next playbook insight dot via email is web dot ML, which is going to provision engine service.

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:14,630
Just going to install engine service, change the configuration bounce engine service.

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:15,360
That's it.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:16,740
Let's name it.

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,270
Web dot ML, same name.

7
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,870
Getting executed on web server group using apt module where installing engine service update caching.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,530
Yes.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,570
In an interval of 24 hours.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:38,340
So an update will run only in the interval of 24 hours after 24 hours have passed, then start and enable

11
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,180
engine service with service module and with file module.

12
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,490
We are going to remove the default engine x website, which is a dislocation.

13
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:49,080
So we say with file module.

14
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:50,580
This is the path state absence.

15
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,990
It's going to remove this file.

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:59,480
And then it's going to push our own configuration file with template module engine X configuration engine

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,740
X for J2.

18
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:02,450
That's the configuration.

19
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:07,640
So it's going to engine X will listen on Port 80 and any request that comes will be forwarded to AB

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,320
zero one on Port 88.

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,570
Kim, let's go back.

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,010
So that will be deployed at this location inside siphon available directory.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,410
And then you have to create a link to enable the site.

24
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,040
So with file module we are creating a link with sites hyphen available the file that we copied.

25
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,810
And the destination is this.

26
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:30,840
So this is going to be the link state link.

27
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,330
Once that is done, that's the configuration changes you.

28
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,600
Then you call the handler to restart engine service.

29
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,130
The handler will restart engine service and that's the last playbook.

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:42,900
Let's save it.

31
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:48,540
Committed engine start engine ICS playbook.
