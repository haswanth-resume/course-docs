1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:04,830
Now let's start writing our playbook one by one in the same order.

2
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,290
So for now, I'm going to close all this.

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,160
And I'll open.

4
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:17,430
Vimal billed Vimal we have to create first.

5
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,840
So in the same order.

6
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:24,420
Provision Stack file build dot y.

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,000
L.

8
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:33,870
OC build playbook will get executed locally on the local host on the controller machine.

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,770
Let's become.

10
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:39,330
Yes, we don't need to give that, but because it's already an ansible configuration file.

11
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:40,320
But that's fine.

12
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:46,920
So we're going to first install some dependencies by using APT module in a loop, we're going to run

13
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,190
this git open JDK eight and MAVEN.

14
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:51,970
Next.

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,840
By using Git module, we're going to clone our repository.

16
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,340
Branch VP hyphen rim.

17
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:03,650
We're going to put it into this directory and register output into a variable.

18
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,410
Then we'll run the we'll use command module and we'll run the command and even install.

19
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,260
And it will do a CD change directory into V profile hyphen repo right there.

20
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,190
Only if there is a commit.

21
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,630
So get underscore status dot changed.

22
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,320
All right.

23
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:23,820
So this will be true if there is any new commit.

24
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:25,310
It's only if a new commit is there?

25
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,600
I would like to build it and register the output into this variable.

26
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,640
Now we should have the artifact.

27
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,220
So by using copy module, we'll copy the artifacts source.

28
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:47,080
So we profile report target slash star dot var Any var file in the target directory will be copied to

29
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:48,310
the files directory.

30
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,010
So we should also have a files directory then.

31
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:52,900
So let's create a files directory.

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:02:01,160
And we make sure we create some empty file in that so it can keep track of this path.

33
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:14,140
Okay, so in the file directory route dot var artifact will be copied.

34
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:18,910
Then we're going to copy the SQL file into the files directory again.

35
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:25,960
So we profile repo Z Main Resources DB backup dot SQL file will be copied into this directory with this

36
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,500
name.

37
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,230
Let's save this.

38
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:37,420
If you don't wish to write all the steps, then you can copy all this from our source code repository.

39
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,820
As of now, I'm going to save this.

40
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:40,870
Commit this.

41
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:44,410
It's a build playbook.

42
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:58,270
Okay, First I will just run this playbook individually, not through Cytomel, just to make a test.

43
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:01,110
So let's pull everything.

44
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,190
So we should have now built vimal file a files directory also.

45
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,930
Let's run the playbook.

46
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:19,210
Okay, while this is happening, we'll write the next playbook.
