1
00:00:02,009 --> 00:00:03,610
The next playbook is set.

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,150
Host IP map dot html.

3
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:08,100
So let's create a file.

4
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:14,830
This playbook is very simple.

5
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:18,550
It's just going to include the variable group was host IP.

6
00:00:22,530 --> 00:00:26,100
So all these variables will be available in the playbook.

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,860
It's going to use block in file module.

8
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:32,229
It is the host file of all the hosts.

9
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:35,310
It's it's going to get executed on all the hosts, including.

10
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,050
Web app rabbit MQ mem cache db everything.

11
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,620
If you wish, we can also update the control machine over here, so let's check in our inventory file.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:53,400
That all the hosts, including the control machine, the local host controller machine.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,560
So in this machine also it will get updated.

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,790
So you don't need to do anything.

15
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,620
So let's see if this comet.

16
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,000
Yeah.

17
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:14,850
Let's go back.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,170
And by the time this playbook is also executed, let's see the output.

19
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,540
It should be in the files directory.

20
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,690
So we have route dot, var and the SQL file.

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:26,400
That's nice.

22
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,620
Now, let's pull our source code.

23
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:34,300
Now you should see the new playbook.

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,010
Let's execute it.

25
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,650
Now that's done.

26
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,670
That was very quick.

27
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,130
Let's check the host file.

28
00:01:48,140 --> 00:01:52,460
This is you can log into every machine and check, but we can check it really on the local machine.

29
00:01:52,460 --> 00:01:53,510
Also controller.

30
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:02,090
Right now, we can really do quickly access to that login and you can see open to.

31
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:07,000
At the rate we can say zero one, let's test it.

32
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:09,789
And seems working.

33
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:10,930
Yeah.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:11,980
That's good.

35
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:12,910
Let's log out.

36
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:21,430
Now we'll write all our playbook and we'll execute them from Wireman.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,500
Guess the site will.

38
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,390
You can close this, you can close this whole strip build and test.
