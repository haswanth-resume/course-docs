1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:00,940
Okay.

2
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:02,760
Now, let's get into the controller.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:04,710
Let's run.

4
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:05,610
Get, pull, set, pull.

5
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,140
All the changes that we made.

00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,030
This is good.

7
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,280
Let's go to provision Stack.

8
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,020
If we're going to execute side of playbook again.

9
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:22,350
So if you already executed Beloit via email and this file which set up the host entries, these two

10
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,090
file will get executed once again.

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,720
Then DB dot ML will set up the database service.

12
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,450
DB deploy will deploy SQL file.

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,270
MEM cache is going to set up mem cache service.

16
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,370
Also, anything fails, it's going to roll back as well.

17
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:48,990
And finally, Engine X will be set up by web dot ML.

18
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,290
Once the engine comes up, starts serving the request, it will be also in the load balancer will show.

19
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:03,490
In the instances it will show in service once the Internet service comes up.

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,300
All right.

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,740
Let's do it.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,360
