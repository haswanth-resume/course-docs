1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:08,760
Next playbook is for Rabbit MQ, which is also similar, but it has few extra steps for the dependencies.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:10,320
It has a lot of dependencies.

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,570
So I'll create the playbook.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:20,390
So getting executed on our MQ server group.

5
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,580
First we have to install Erlang.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,960
For that we need to add the repository detail By using APT module we say DEP and we say this is the

7
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,010
repository.

8
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,760
Link.

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,540
And with apt underscore key module, we add the key.

10
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,540
To authenticate that repository.

11
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,840
Then we say install Erlang with APT module, we install Erlang.

12
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,530
Now airline will get installed from this repository but we have to run apt update also.

13
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,610
So update caching module which will run apt update and then install Erlang.

14
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:59,800
Appropriate will be done in an interval of 86400 seconds.

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,180
That's 24 hours.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:04,620
Okay, then one more module.

17
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,370
APT underscore repository.

18
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,330
We're going to add this repository.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,340
This is for rabbit MQ.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:17,140
Once we have this repository, we can use ABT module to install Rabbit MCU Server update cache.

21
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,000
Yes, it's going to run app update.

22
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:23,710
It's going to fetch the packages list from here and install rabbit MQ server.

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:28,460
And then once we have rabbit MQ, we'll start and enable the service.

24
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,820
Little configuration change with copy module.

25
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,890
We're going to copy this content.

26
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:41,650
Into this rabbit MQ configuration file.

27
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:45,670
Once we made the configuration, we're going to bounce the rabbit MQ service.

28
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:47,680
So it's say notify restart, rabbit MQ.

29
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,490
So at the end you have the handler which will get called.

30
00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:00,380
Rabbit MQ underscore user module to add a rabbit MQ user.

31
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,430
Thankfully, we have such module.

32
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:04,490
Otherwise we have to use the command module.

33
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:09,289
So rabbit MQ user module, we're going to add user name test, password test.

34
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,300
And if you go back to a template application to.

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,130
Be using the same user.

36
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:21,300
So if you're making any changes over here, then you make sure you make the changes over here as well.

37
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,980
Or you can declare them as a variable and you can refer in both the places.

38
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:33,190
Get few options to give all the privileges tag administrator and call the handler.

39
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:38,320
So once the user is created, it can call the handler, but handler will be called at the end.

40
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,020
Next we have to install one plugin rabbit mq underscore plugin module is there to install rabbit mq

41
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,320
plug in rabbit view underscore management.

42
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:55,080
And so, again, calling the handler now, the handler will be called because this is the last task.

43
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:03,200
Handler will be called and Rabbit, you will get restarted a little longer playbook compared to DB and

44
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:10,010
Mem cache only because we have a lot of dependencies and we are also adding user of rabbit MQ and installing

45
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,240
a rabbit MQ plugin.

46
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:17,150
Apart from that, this playbook is as similar as DB or mem cache playbook.

47
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:23,330
Install packages, start an enable service, make some configuration change and restart the service.

48
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,870
So let's see if this commit this.
