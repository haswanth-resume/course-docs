1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,540
Now.

2
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:04,290
Now let's start writing a playbook to provision our entire stack.

3
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,430
Okay, So now in our repository, we had this previous playbooks that we used to set up VPC and launch

4
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,300
instances.

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:19,520
We'll just close all of this.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,570
To avoid any clutter.

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,310
Okay, First we need to take care of our variables.

8
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,830
So we already have in group bars.

9
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,490
We have the variables, the IP addresses of for all our machines.

10
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,890
We also have the inventory file.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:40,200
We need one more variable.

12
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm going to create a new file here.

13
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:46,970
DB RV group.

14
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,440
Create that file text file.

15
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,210
So we'll give DB user, DB pass and DB name the three variables.

16
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,620
We'll also need to templates that we'll be pushing it to our application server and web server respectively.

17
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,950
So we'll create a template directory here.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,110
In this templates, we'll create two files.

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,740
Application dot j to.

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,680
This is going to be our application properties file.

21
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:32,210
So the data for this file you can pick up from our source code so you can go to our repository, we

22
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:38,120
profile project and you can go to VB hyphen branch or any CD branch.

23
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:38,960
You can go.

24
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:42,050
HRC main.

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,350
Resources.

26
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,590
Application date properties file.

27
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:51,370
Let's copy it.

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:01:59,760
Okay.

29
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:01,090
We don't need to make any change here.

30
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:05,430
DB 0101 This is we're going to prepare a host file.

31
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:10,880
It is the host file and push it on every machine so our application server should be able to connect

32
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:13,940
to with to the backend with their names.

33
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:16,430
Okay, we need one more template.

34
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:23,480
For engine x engine x v pro g two For simplicity.

35
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:25,080
Keep the same name for now.

36
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:30,350
There's going to be the routing entry for when we access engine service.

37
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,330
It's going to route to the application server.

38
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,190
So that should be the content.

39
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,950
If we access it on Port 80, it's going to listen on port it.

40
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:47,150
It's going to route the request to app zero one on Port 88.

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,670
These two configurations are important.

42
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,680
So when it routes to application server application Server four backend is going to use this file to

43
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,740
route to database cache and rabbit MQ.

44
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,490
DB password admin and DB user admin and password one to admin.

45
00:03:02,490 --> 00:03:03,270
One, two, three.

46
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,590
You mentioned the same in the variables file, so we're going to use that in our playbook.

47
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,860
Also for rabbit to test user and test password.

48
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,020
Okay, that should be good.

49
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,730
Let's close this one for now.

50
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,610
Except this one provision stack.

51
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,880
Now we'll create ansible configuration file.

52
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,380
So does the configuration file.

53
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,290
In default settings, we have inventory inventory hyphen vpro.

54
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,270
Which is this file.

55
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,400
Post key checking false Forks five.

56
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:42,580
That's not mandatory setting log file.

57
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,010
It will also create a log file in current working directory.

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:48,980
Timeout 15 seconds privilege escalation becomes Yes.

59
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,980
You don't need to mention it in your playbook as this connection tries to time.

60
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,830
We need that for some of our execution.

61
00:03:58,010 --> 00:04:04,730
Okay, so by now you should have two variables file DB server, host IP two templates, application

62
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:10,640
G, two engine x, Vpro or G two and simple configuration file and inventory file.
