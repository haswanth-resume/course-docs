1
00:00:03,010 --> 00:00:03,610
Now.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,650
I'm going to write a side note with my playbook first.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,420
The master playbook that is going to call all the other playbooks so you can see the flow of execution

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,020
as well.

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,100
So at this level provision, stack level, I'm going to create a file named as site dot YAML.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:21,820
This is going to be a master playbook.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,940
And that's the content.

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:27,600
So we have first we're going to import Playbook build.

9
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:33,870
This playbook is going to build the artifact locally on the control machine.

10
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:36,030
Then another playbook will get executed.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:40,320
This is going to update the host file, the Etsy host file.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,490
It will use all the IP address that we have mentioned in the variables file.

13
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:54,230
Next is DB will playbook will execute so it or it will execute This playbook is going to install the

14
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,120
database make sure it's up and running.

15
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,470
DB deploy ML is going to take our SQL file.

16
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,470
And we'll run all the SQL queries from that.

17
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:11,640
So DB, a SQL file will be pushed by build, ML file and build ML file will take the source code and

18
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,400
build the artifact.

19
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:18,240
The same time, we'll also push the SQL file so DB deploy DB deployed.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,590
ML can execute that.

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:26,680
Next will be Mom Cash Playbook, which is going to install, start and make sure cash is running on

22
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:28,600
port 112, one one.

23
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:33,670
Then Rabbit and CU Playbook, which will install all the rabbit MQ dependencies.

24
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,830
Install rabbit MQ create rabbit Q user with password and some privilege.

25
00:01:39,730 --> 00:01:41,830
Next is Application Server playbook.

26
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:47,330
This playbook is going to install and set up Tomcat servers and also deploy the artifact.

27
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:54,400
The artifact will be built by build file and we'll already push it from this playbook to application

28
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,840
server in the temp directory.

29
00:01:56,410 --> 00:02:00,430
And this playbook is going to take that artifact from temp directory and deploy it in.

30
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:03,230
Tomcat Home Directory.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,720
Next.

32
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,789
Finally, the Vimal file, which is going to provision Engine X service.

33
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:17,150
Application server app server file is going to use this template application due to website.

34
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:20,550
Primal Playbook is going to use this template engine X with pro dot J2.

35
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,880
So we are going to write all this file in the same order.

36
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,920
Now let's save this and I would also like to commit it.

37
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:32,710
Commit.

38
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,580
And I would also like to push it.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,830
Okay, let's fetch that.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,630
There's not going to be any execution now because we have not written any new playbooks.

41
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:50,530
But you should see we have provision stack directory.

42
00:02:53,350 --> 00:03:01,600
In that we have inventory file ansible configuration file login key side can now in inventory.

43
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,400
It's mentioning the login key.

44
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:10,270
Can't log in key for all the instance which we have already copied.

45
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:15,540
And this is not part of your version Control.

46
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:21,670
We are not keeping keys in the version control so you should not see this keys from your ID, You will

47
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:26,200
not see it anywhere because in the get ignored file we are saying ignore PEM files.
