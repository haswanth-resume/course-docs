1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,730
Next playbook cache will.

2
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:05,580
This is also a very easy playbook.

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:18,130
Executing on MSI server group with apt module very installing mem cache.

4
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:23,080
We start and enable mem cache service and then we enable the remote login.

5
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,660
So with line in file module, we're going to search anything that starts with hyphen L and replace it

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,360
with hyphen l 0.0.0.

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,900
So then Mukesh will listen on all the IP addresses, not just the local IP.

8
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,650
We can take backup of the file before it make changes, and then we call the handler to restart cache

9
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:44,460
service.

10
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,480
So that's pretty simple.

11
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,170
Playbook.

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,620
Install the package, start and enable make configuration change.

13
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:53,270
Restart the service.
