1
00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:00,840
Okay.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:03,700
So let's look at in a flow now.

3
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,900
So we have to pipeline the staging pipeline and production pipeline.

4
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:14,050
So let's say the developer makes the code change.

5
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,730
Let's switch to.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:18,860
Check out.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:24,020
Stage.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,790
You know, why not just do it?

9
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,120
Everything from the voice code.

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,730
Once again, code dot.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,800
So I'm in the staging branch.

12
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,370
Right.

13
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:43,120
And assuming developers are making code change and really we don't make any code change here while practicing,

14
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,180
we just make some changes to read more file.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:53,980
We'll add some hash there and we'll see control s save assuming developer made the code change.

16
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:54,460
Right.

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,890
Save it and then commit and push.

18
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,030
Okay.

19
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,910
Testing stage pipeline.

20
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:08,180
Control less so developer made the code change.

21
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:09,410
They tested it locally.

22
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,690
Now they're going to push it to.

23
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:14,240
GitHub.

24
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:17,440
And once they push, that should trigger.

25
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,740
This pipeline, staging pipeline there, it got triggered, right?

26
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:24,960
So let's wait for it to complete.

27
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:27,040
Okay.

28
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:30,620
So after a few minutes, the deployment completed successfully.

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:31,760
Right.

30
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:33,800
So gets the notification.

31
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,010
Right.

32
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:40,810
And then the software testing team quality assurance or whoever is responsible test it validates it.

33
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,010
Everything is fine.

34
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:45,910
They give a go ahead to deploy it for the production environment.

35
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:46,360
All right.

36
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:50,920
So all we need to do is then we will check out.

37
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,810
To the production branch.

38
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,060
All right.

39
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,190
Okay, let me clear the screen.

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:03,180
Now we need to merge all the change from staging to production.

41
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,830
Since it is tested, everything is good.

42
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:07,260
So we say get merge.

43
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:14,330
Merged with the staging branch.

44
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,000
The production branch also comes at the same level as the staging branch once that is done.

45
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:23,280
Then the.

46
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:24,360
Sorry.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,440
I need to push it.

48
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:25,740
Right.

49
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,710
Get push origin.

50
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:36,340
You can do it from here or you can do it from the VTS code also.

51
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,320
So we push it.

52
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,010
Let's go to.

53
00:02:42,710 --> 00:02:44,150
The production job.

54
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,130
Okay.

55
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,000
There you see that?

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,990
It already started.

57
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,990
And if you click it later, it will already complete.

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,500
You see that?

59
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,880
That happened very quickly.

60
00:02:56,110 --> 00:03:01,330
So in Bienstock you see we have the new version and the new versions will be also deployed.

61
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,190
Make sure there is a gap in between the staging pipeline and the merge that you do.

62
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:13,360
And because Bienstock is going to take some time to deploy the latest version.

63
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:14,680
Right.

64
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,820
So we have two instances, 50%, one instance at a time.

65
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,400
So it's going to take some time for the deployment.

66
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:29,020
So once the staging environment deployment is completed, then merge the code with the production branch,

67
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:31,450
which will trigger the production deployment pipeline.

68
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,850
And then it is going to deploy the latest version, which will be same as the staging version.

69
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:38,500
All right.

70
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,070
Very well.

71
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:41,170
Once this is tested, all fine.

72
00:03:41,170 --> 00:03:43,750
Try do the deployment a few more times.

73
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,490
See, everything works fine.

74
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:51,280
And when you are done, some cleanup steps we need to do first.

75
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,600
Starting with.

76
00:03:53,590 --> 00:04:00,340
Now let's shut down Jenkins nexus and sooner QB as you'll see extra instances over here those with the

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,210
bean stack instance.

78
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:06,670
So let's select sonar nexus Jenkins and we'll see.

79
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,690
Stop.

80
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,210
Power off.

81
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:14,030
And these Bienstock instance will not do anything.

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:18,959
We will delete the beans tag application, which will in turn delete everything for us.

83
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,700
So the application.

84
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,940
Delete the application.

85
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:28,200
And let's give the application name.

86
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:35,150
And delete, which in tone will delete delete to other environments, to environments, and then delete

87
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:38,000
the application if it is not deleted.

88
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,570
This will take some time, so check after some time.

89
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:44,510
If it is not deleted, then try and delete it multiple times.

90
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,970
Sometimes it just holds.

91
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,910
It is not in the correct state.

92
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,700
We cannot delete it now, so wait and then delete it.

93
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,640
That's all you need to do in the cleanup part.

94
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,950
Delete the profile application and.

95
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:00,750
Stop your instances.

96
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:09,150
If you want, you can delete the S3 bucket but the 17.3 and be not big size it multiple versions you

97
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:10,200
should have right.

98
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:17,290
So this should not take much space so I won't charge you anything.

99
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:22,390
But if you want to delete the three bucket first delete all the objects, then delete the SD bucket.

100
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,610
And that's all in the cleanup part.

101
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,960
Keep the instances.

102
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:26,980
We will need them.

103
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,920
That is all in this lecture.

104
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,960
I will see you in the next one.
