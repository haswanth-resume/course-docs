1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:01,650
All right.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:08,370
It's time to create a pipeline for production environment that is almost similar to staging environment.

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:11,310
As I said, there's a little catch which we'll talk about.

4
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:15,300
But first, we need to create the production environment.

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,980
Let's go to Elastic Beanstalk and go to the applications.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,270
I select your application.

7
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:25,500
I click on that.

8
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:26,250
Yeah.

9
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:29,280
Make sure you are in the application.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,370
You have the environment over here.

11
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,700
This is the staging environment.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,350
We'll create one more environment.

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:36,240
Create new environment.

14
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,380
Web Server Environment Select.

15
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:46,100
And we'll call it as a pro app, prod, hyphen, E and V.

16
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,220
Same name will give in the domain.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,010
Again, you need to give a different name.

18
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:56,730
You can add some numbers over here to make it unique.

19
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,470
So click on check availability if it says it's not available.

20
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,510
Make sure you change something over there and it is unique.

21
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,530
Like a platform.

22
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,120
Same it.

23
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,380
Tomcat.

24
00:01:10,930 --> 00:01:20,170
And sample application configure mode option so similar step capacity will change to to micro.

25
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,540
And we'll see.

26
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,820
Load balanced.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,610
Minimum two maximum for.

28
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:34,030
Let's come down.

29
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,180
See.

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,290
Rolling updates and deployments.

31
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,020
Rolling deployment policy and 50%.

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,230
So that will be one instance of greed at a time.

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:53,610
See.

34
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,420
And that is it will create the environment.

35
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:02,250
And we'll wait for it to come up.

36
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,780
So I'll pause my screen and come back when this is ready.

37
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,699
After waiting a few minutes.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,530
It has created the environment, the production environment, and if you click on the link, it will

39
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:18,080
have the sample application.

40
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:25,330
Now, before we go ahead and write the pipeline code, we will make the health check change.

41
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
Same with it for staging environment.

42
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,650
We will change the load balancer health check from slash to slash login.

43
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,540
So configuration load balancer and then come to the processes.

44
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:44,000
I can edit and change the health check to slash login.

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,110
And apply the change as we did.

46
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,920
Same for the staging environment.

47
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,400
This will also take some time and the health will go to the degraded state.

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,020
Once we deploy our artefact, it will come in an okay state.

49
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,150
Okay, let's write our code.

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:06,620
Let's go to get Bash and let me create a new branch.

51
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:07,260
Get.

52
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:18,860
Branch git check out hyphen B and this one to.

53
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,650
Prod.

54
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,490
Let's open the code.

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,720
Code dot.

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,370
Nat opens the voice code.

57
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,490
So he's asking to publish the new branch.

58
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,020
We will be doing that.

59
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,130
But let's make the code change now.

60
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,720
I said there is a catch and this is the catch.

61
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,660
So we have application versions.

62
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:50,070
Now this version is deployed to the staging environment and let's say it is tested and everything comes

63
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,860
out fine.

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,690
Now we need to deploy that same version to the production, right?

65
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:02,910
If manually, we just put a checkmark action and we can say deploy and we can select the production

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:03,870
environment.

67
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:08,700
But we have to do this from our Jenkins file intelligently.

68
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,950
So it picks up that version, the same one which is deployed to the staging environment.

69
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,820
How will do that?

70
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,540
Well, turns out it's pretty simple.

71
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:21,120
Now, for versioning, we're using the build ID.

72
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:22,800
Let's go to the Jenkins.

73
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,430
So in this right staging pipeline, the latest build out is three.

74
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,430
It is the successful build and this is the same we are using for the version.

75
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,680
So if this complete successfully, it is tested, everything is fine.

76
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:47,150
We what we would like to fetch the same build I.D. from this pipeline this pipeline into the production

77
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:47,930
pipeline.

78
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,650
So.

79
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:53,130
In our Jenkins file for production.

80
00:04:54,270 --> 00:05:01,680
We need to find out a way from where we can fetch the latest build from the staging pipeline, and this

81
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,760
is how it will be done.

82
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,940
We define a variable.

83
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,660
You can use any variable you want.

84
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:11,340
I just say build number Jenkins dot instance dot get item job name here.

85
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,110
We mentioned the job name.

86
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,090
So let's go to Jenkins.

87
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,470
Let's copy that job name exactly as it is.

88
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:22,500
And we put it there.

89
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:29,350
Dart last successful build number which currently is three.

90
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:36,130
So it's going to this command is going to fetch the builder three and store it into this variable.

91
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,180
Right.

92
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:37,960
And.

93
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:41,430
For the artefact name.

94
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,640
We are going to mention that variable, not the builder because if we mention build ID here, it will

95
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:52,080
be the build ID of this pipeline, the production pipeline, which is wrong.

96
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:58,590
We want the build idea of staging pipeline so that variable put it there.

97
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:06,270
So that defines the artifact that you want to deploy and the app version that you want to deploy.

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:13,760
Now that gets us the last successful build number from the staging pipeline, which we use for versioning

99
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,390
and which we use for the naming of the artifact.

100
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,760
But when we come down here.

101
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,670
The commands are to upload the artifact.

102
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,870
Now that is only there in the bucket.

103
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,570
The same artifact we want to deploy.

104
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,340
So we don't want this command.

105
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,340
Let's remove that.

106
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:32,170
The second one create application version.

107
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:32,750
Oops.

108
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,410
Create application version that is also already there.

109
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:39,920
The same version we want to deploy to production.

110
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:40,320
Right.

111
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:42,330
So we'll remove that as well.

112
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,420
So only thing remaining is update the environment.

113
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:48,120
Right.

114
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,840
And with this version.

115
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:53,110
Right.

116
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:55,810
And that variable we already defined here.

117
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:58,820
Right.

118
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:06,510
That vision, which is the last build number so turns out to be just not not we don't need to add anything

119
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,650
in the pipeline.

120
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,990
We need to actually remove the commands.

121
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:11,820
Right.

122
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,930
So this command is going to simply do this.

123
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,760
It's a big stack.

124
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:26,970
Yeah, it's going to go to that find that Virgin label and it's going to see action, deploy and selectable

125
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,960
production environment.

126
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:29,540
That's all it is going to do.

127
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,690
That's all we need to do also.

128
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:33,600
Okay.

129
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:34,670
Okay.

130
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:37,020
So the rest of the things you do not need.

131
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,890
So let's remove all the other stages.

132
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,360
So I'm going to select all the stages.

133
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:45,600
Yeah.

134
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,220
Sorry.

135
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:47,990
Yeah.

136
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,760
All the stages will remove.

137
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,130
This is just a deployment for the production.

138
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,780
Only one stage you need.

139
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,860
Yeah, that's that.

140
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,150
Let's compare stages.

141
00:08:02,450 --> 00:08:05,090
Stage steps.

142
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:06,150
Okay.

143
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:06,830
This is good.

144
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:07,740
Let's see it.

145
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:12,580
And let's say comet and push.

146
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,270
My plan code for prod.

147
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,400
Put that checkmark.

148
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:28,390
Let's create a pipeline for this branch.

149
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,350
So let's go to Jenkins.

150
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:31,820
Oh.

151
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,990
One more thing.

152
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,820
Let's go back to voice code.

153
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,409
The environment name.

154
00:08:36,409 --> 00:08:37,909
We have just kept it as it is.

155
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:40,880
This is supposed to be the production environment deployment.

156
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,340
So we need to give the production.

157
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:49,340
Environment name with pro app, hyphen pro or hyphen E and V.

158
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:51,980
So make sure you update that.

159
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:59,430
Save it once again, and then we commit and push it once again.

160
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,280
Push to prod e and V control s.

161
00:09:07,310 --> 00:09:08,660
Put that checkmark.

162
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:11,380
Okay.

163
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,080
Now let's go to Jenkins.

164
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,630
New item.

165
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,290
Clive Jenkins.

166
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:26,640
I haven't been hyphen proud.

167
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:30,510
Pipeline and copy everything from.

168
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:32,760
Yeah.

169
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,770
That one.

170
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:35,580
Cecil Jenkins.

171
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:35,960
I'm sorry.

172
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:36,390
Yeah.

173
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,680
Been staging.

174
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:45,980
Now, the only thing we need to change now, after we copied everything, that will be just the branch

175
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,930
name here.

176
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,630
All right, so we created this branch CCD.

177
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:53,310
Jen Bean hyphen prod.

178
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,320
Let's see if this.

179
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,710
And time to test it.

180
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,700
Wait.

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,420
Before you run this pipeline, make sure your environment.

182
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,630
Yeah.

183
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:06,980
It's settled.

184
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:09,290
Yes, it will be in civil state, but it is settled.

185
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,790
There's no change happening there.

186
00:10:11,810 --> 00:10:12,130
Okay.

187
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,520
Now let's do build now.

188
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,240
Yeah.

189
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,310
Okay, that failed.

190
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,600
Let's see what happened.

191
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:20,690
Okay.

192
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:23,020
Now, this was expected.

193
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:29,890
When you are trying to fetch the builder ID from another pipeline, another job, it will ask you for

194
00:10:29,890 --> 00:10:30,700
the approval.

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:31,870
Okay.

196
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:34,630
So administrators can decide, okay, fine.

197
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:38,170
So control and click on it opens a new tab.

198
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,410
I'd ask for the approval.

199
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:42,520
Just say approve.

200
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,620
Right.

201
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,230
You need to go back once again.

202
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,370
And you do this a few times.

203
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,780
Run once again, Bill.

204
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,290
Now.

205
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,440
Okay.

206
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:00,730
It's not giving the signature, though.

207
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:02,380
Okay.

208
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,240
I need to go here.

209
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,310
Dashboard Manager Jenkins.

210
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,440
In process script approval.

211
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:11,440
Click on that.

212
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:13,640
Hmm.

213
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,820
Doesn't show anything approve.

214
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:18,850
It should add.

215
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,130
Yeah.

216
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:19,910
Yeah.

217
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,300
That it should have done here, also approved.

218
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:25,080
Yeah.

219
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:25,570
Okay, fine.

220
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:26,620
We don't need to go there.

221
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:29,360
Okay.

222
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:31,490
Just click on Approve, then go back.

223
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,380
And you need to do this a few times.

224
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:37,100
Because it sets approval for different, different things.

225
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,390
Okay.

226
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:39,990
One more time.

227
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:40,770
It failed.

228
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,060
Once again.

229
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,650
Now this is just one time.

230
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,650
Approve.

231
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:47,190
Okay.

232
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,970
So you see, keep adding things over here for the approval.

233
00:11:51,630 --> 00:11:53,310
All right, so second one there.

234
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:55,470
Yeah.

235
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:57,520
Once again, so totally.

236
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,380
I think it's 3 to 4 times.

237
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:01,920
To get the build.

238
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,290
Number 41 also failed.

239
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:05,960
Yeah, I know.

240
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,710
It's annoying.

241
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:07,760
You can.

242
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:10,970
You just need to do it once and once it is done.

243
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:14,860
Once it starts running, then every time it will run.

244
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:19,950
Okay.

245
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,450
I think this is the last time.

246
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,280
True.

247
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:28,710
I see different different things there.

248
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:29,970
It's.

249
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:31,220
It's for the approval.

250
00:12:32,650 --> 00:12:33,460
They now?

251
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:37,740
Okay.

252
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:38,770
Yeah, that triggered.

253
00:12:38,770 --> 00:12:38,890
No.

254
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,200
So we did it like, what, four times.

255
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:43,390
But this is only once.

256
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:45,880
Okay, so the deployment completed successfully.

257
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,160
Let's check the production environment.

258
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:50,340
Okay.

259
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:55,980
So the upgrade is still going on and you see batch one is already completed.

260
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:58,450
That means one instance deployment is completed.

261
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,540
It's going for the second instance now.

262
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,540
Once both the incidents are upgraded with the latest version.

263
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,620
Then the upgrade will be completed.

264
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:11,520
Let's wait for a few minutes.

265
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:13,740
Okay.

266
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,870
They are it completed successfully.

267
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,920
And as you see the running version, it is still showing sample application.

268
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,870
But if you refresh the page.

269
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:26,070
Then you should see three.

270
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:31,500
That's the same one deployed for the staging environment also.

271
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,770
Right.

272
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,870
So that's so staging environment.

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,050
It has the vision tree and the production environment that is also having the version three.

274
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:45,170
So there we have successfully tested both the pipeline.

275
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:47,770
Now it's time to look at in a flow.

276
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:51,070
So complete this and join me in the next lecture.
