1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:01,609
All right.

2
00:00:01,609 --> 00:00:04,090
In this lecture, we will be doing three things.

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:06,890
One, creating an S3 bucket.

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:14,300
Second create I am user with correct policy beans tech policy and as three policy.

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:17,310
Third, creating the beans tag application.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:18,920
Let's start with.

7
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,400
Am.

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,980
Let's go to Imam.

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,560
Users.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,890
Add user.

11
00:00:31,390 --> 00:00:34,420
We'll call this a secede hyphen been.

12
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,250
Programmatic access next.

13
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,420
Attach existing policy.

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,700
Now this user will be used by a CLI and it needs to first access the S3 bucket to upload and download

15
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,660
the artifact.

16
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:57,460
So Amazon is three full access and it will also access the bean stack environment.

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:01,590
To deploy the latest artifact from S3 bucket.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:08,730
So being stack full access also will give to two policy being stack and S3.

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,680
Okay.

20
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,970
Let's create the user.

21
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:19,590
Download the CSV file.

22
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,550
So let's see these credentials in the Jenkins right now.

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,860
So go to manage Jenkins.

24
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,060
Manage credentials.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Jenkins.

26
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,290
Global credentials.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,850
Now there's already a credential access keys and secret keys saved in my Jenkins from previous projects,

28
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,420
but that does not have correct policy as we need.

29
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,000
So we create a new credentials.

30
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,690
Will say plus credentials.

31
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:04,140
We limit as has been crits.

32
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,750
Let's paste the axis key here.

33
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:18,090
And the secret key.

34
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,750
Now yes, I will be clicking on show and you will be seeing my secret key also.

35
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,990
But after this lecture, I'm going to delete this one.

36
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,220
Create.

37
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,130
Remember this name?

38
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:35,650
A bean bean creds.

39
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:41,260
We will be using this in our click command to deploy our artifact to bean stack.

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:43,330
It will be in the Jenkins file.

41
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,640
Now get one thing knocked out.

42
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:49,870
Let's go to S3.

43
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,760
Let's create an S3 bucket.

44
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,100
So I will say create bucket.

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,940
And let's give Bucket a name.

46
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:02,990
I will call it as a pro C, C, D bin.

47
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,940
Now you make sure you create the bucket with a different name because I'm already using this name.

48
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,760
You will not be able to use this name.

49
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,110
So create a different name of your S3 bucket if you want it unique.

50
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,290
Just add some numbers like that so it becomes unique.

51
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:19,540
Okay.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,550
So let's just go down.

53
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,180
That's it.

54
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,590
Just create bucket.

55
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,650
Okay.

56
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:30,100
Now, the last thing is Bienstock.

57
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,630
This is where we'll be deploying our artifact.

58
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,290
You must have already experience with Bienstock if you're following all the projects we used Bienstock.

59
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:49,350
When we did Re Architecture Project, we hosted a profile application on Bienstock and then we configured

60
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,400
the backend services.

61
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,940
Also in this project will be just configuring Bienstock.

62
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:56,400
Not the back end services.

63
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:57,500
So create application.

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,730
Let's give it a name.

65
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,090
I will just call it as Vpro app again.

66
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,200
Give a different name.

67
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,550
Make sure it's unique.

68
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,190
Platform Tomcat.

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,250
Take all defaults, configure more options.

70
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,640
Custom configuration.

71
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:20,720
So we will be changing the capacity we will be having.

72
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,290
To micro only, not to too small.

73
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:28,280
And we will say we need two instances minimum.

74
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,870
Two maximum for.

75
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:34,270
And save.

76
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:38,570
Deployment, rolling updates and deployment.

77
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,260
Edit.

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,280
So we don't want it to do all at once.

79
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:44,060
You want to do it one at a time.

80
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,990
So rolling.

81
00:04:45,590 --> 00:04:51,080
So we are seeing two instances to start with and we are going to give size 50%.

82
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,850
So it's going to upgrade one instance at a time.

83
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:55,610
We will be seeing how it upgrades.

84
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,760
And that is it.

85
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,490
Save.

86
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:00,410
Okay.

87
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,940
Later, we need to do the health check changes to slash logging for the load for the target group.

88
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,990
We will do that.

89
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,780
Let's create the app now.

90
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,730
So this will take some time.

91
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:17,510
I'm going to pause my screen and come back when this is completed.

92
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:18,900
Okay.

93
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:21,320
After like 5 minutes it completed.

94
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,450
So we have an application.

95
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,070
Let's click on applications.

96
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,310
Application name pro app.

97
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,040
It has an environment, the pro app, hyphen E and V.

98
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,820
This will use for staging and for production.

99
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,180
We'll create one more environment in the same application.

100
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,460
So let's click on this environment.

101
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,890
This environment is running a sample application.

102
00:05:46,890 --> 00:05:48,870
That's the URL of the load balancer.

103
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:52,530
If you click on that control and click.

104
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,930
So that's the sample application.

105
00:05:56,140 --> 00:06:02,650
And if we come to application versions, we can see this and this is deployed in the environment.

106
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:05,680
So application can have multiple versions.

107
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,240
You can choose and select to deploy.

108
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,690
On the environment that you want.

109
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:16,840
We currently just have one environment and the same portion is deployed.

110
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:25,030
We will see in the next lectures how we are going to upload our own version and deploy it to the right

111
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,050
environment.

112
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,970
So that is all here in this lecture.

113
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,840
Complete this and join me in the next lecture.
