1
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:01,110
Okay.

2
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:03,780
I have logged into my console.

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,480
So we will be doing three simple things.

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,220
In this lecture, we test validate our continuous integration pipeline.

5
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:22,410
We update the Jenkins new IP in GitHub webhook and we log into Jenkins search and install CLI.

6
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:28,090
So first thing, that's power on all our instances.

7
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:33,550
I will wait for it to get the IP address already.

8
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:34,110
Got it.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,120
So you got the public IP for the Jenkins.

10
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:37,150
Let's copy that.

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,590
And let's go to GitHub, our repository that we created previously.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,370
And we'll go to the settings of this repository.

13
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,870
The books.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,120
Edit.

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,890
Enter the password.

16
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:00,560
Change the public IP to the latest one.

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:03,290
Click on update webhook.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:05,200
Okay.

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,420
Let's go back to Jenkins.

20
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,830
Jenkins?

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,180
Yeah.

22
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,030
The AP once again.

23
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:12,360
That's open 80.

24
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,030
80.

25
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:15,030
Log in.

26
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:20,910
And let's test the continuous integration pipeline.

27
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:26,080
We profile CI pipeline build now.

28
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,930
While this is happening, let's do a search to the Jenkins and install a clean.

29
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,560
I am opening my gate bash.

30
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,770
This is a chip and I downloads the profile 61 to.

31
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:54,950
Okay.

32
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:57,190
I need to update the security group rule.

33
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:59,690
Let's go to security.

34
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,699
I get 22 from my IP.

35
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,979
That gives me the new IP.

36
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:12,850
Okay.

37
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,250
Let's try once again.

38
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,330
Okay.

39
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,240
Let's clear the screen sudo apt update.

40
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,390
Sudo apt install a w s line.

41
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,450
This is already installed in my jenkins and hopefully it's installed in your machine as well.

42
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:46,370
In previous continuous delivery projects we installed a CLI, so it should be there.

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:49,520
But if you build a new jenkins, then you need to install it.

44
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:50,150
Okay.

45
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,730
Let's check the status of our CI pipeline.

46
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:57,830
That completed successfully.

47
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,150
So we are good to go.

48
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:01,170
Wrap this up.

49
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,030
Join me in the next lecture where we'll set up some services.
