1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,270
So, Jenkins, what are your dog?

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,370
And you can click on Pipeline here.

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,390
And you can see getting started with Pipeline.

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:10,640
What is Jenkins Pipeline?

5
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:11,700
You can read about it.

6
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,149
Declarative versus scripted pipeline syntax.

7
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,560
Declarative is now way forward.

8
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,830
Scripted was what you will see, but it's still supported.

9
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:29,310
There's a syntax and every step is mentioned.

10
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:30,290
What they do.

11
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:38,940
Some example of the pipeline like we did build, test and will deploy it also.

12
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:47,610
The empirical side defining a pipeline, how you can define a pipeline as we did.

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,990
That's the way we did pipeline script.

14
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:54,390
We put our script over there and we executed it.

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,960
There's also one more thing.

16
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:02,560
There is a snippet generator you can generate.

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,480
You can mention something over here.

18
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:08,200
You can give a name and you can click on Generate Pipeline script it will generate.

19
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,270
The snippet for you.

20
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:12,430
It's in our Jenkins.

21
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:30,700
Look, some examples are also given over here like steps shall command and executing unit tool to read

22
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,540
the XML.

23
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,340
Deploy.

24
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:36,230
Expression.

25
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,000
You can put a conditions also.

26
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,880
Defining variables in your Jenkins file.

27
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,970
So you have to say def variable and its value to def really means I'm defining a variable.

28
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,340
I know if you see the only python, if you python if you already use python def there means something

29
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:57,610
else.

30
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,320
It's defining a function here.

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,030
It means defining a variable.

32
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,990
Using environment variable.

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,300
You can use environment variable also in your pipeline like build ID build number, which you're going

34
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,289
to use also.

35
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:13,040
Like this.

36
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,280
Ian.

37
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,180
We don't build it in curly braces.

38
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:21,760
Curly braces, and you have to say envy and the variable and this is going to return you the build it

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,480
can't build it.

40
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:26,770
So that's how you access variable in your Jenkins file.

41
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:32,810
Setting variables value dynamically.

42
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,830
Handling credentials.

43
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:37,570
How can you access credentials?

44
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:43,910
Usernames and passwords.

45
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,130
So there are a lot of information over here, but you must be using some plugins like we're using Nexus

46
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:55,060
Artifact uploader plugin or we're using Sonar KUBE scanner plugin.

47
00:02:55,330 --> 00:03:01,180
Those information will not be over here, how to write those things, but you can check that into the

48
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,160
documentation of the plugin itself.

49
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:11,970
Okay, so I just did a little search Sonar Jenkins plugin and sonar cube documentation you have directly.

50
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,290
You can search that.

51
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:14,250
You can find that.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,730
So.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,750
Scroll down using a Jenkins pipeline, how you can use that with sonar.

54
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:24,620
Cuban environment.

55
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:26,210
You mentioned the environment.

56
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:27,800
All right.

57
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,000
Printing something over here.

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:37,970
Node any o stage seem fetching the source code stage sooner analysis defining your sooner scanner tool

59
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:38,270
there.

60
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,650
Let me zoom it a bit.

61
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,620
So like we from global tool configuration, we say sonar scanner.

62
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:50,430
We want to download sonar scanner from Jenkins global tool configuration.

63
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,900
And we mention it over there.

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,050
And then in the pipeline we mentioned which tool you want to use.

65
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,040
We give the name.

66
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,160
So defining variable, actually.

67
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:00,210
All right.

68
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,700
With sonar cube environment.

69
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,180
Then you give the your sonar cube server detail.

70
00:04:04,190 --> 00:04:12,410
So as in a continuous integration project with Jenkins, we have set up the Jenkins and sonar integration.

71
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,050
All right.

72
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:13,640
So.

73
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:18,769
Mannie Jenkins.

74
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:21,920
Configure system.

75
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,970
And this is where we included there.

76
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,170
So why not keep server?

77
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
So we have given the owner hyphen pro you URL and the token.

78
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,500
So this is your owner cube environment.

79
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,550
And I actually have to say switch sooner, Cuban environment, give the environment name and the execution

80
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,540
that you want to do.

81
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:48,120
So this is going to execute the sonar scanner scanner home, which is declared over here.

82
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:51,650
So it's going to call this tool run the sonar scanner.

83
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,150
All right.

84
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,230
And there are a few more steps that we are going to mention.

85
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,810
We're going to pass so many parameters to it.

86
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,130
So first, you know how to write a Jenkins file, and then you can put any plug in that you want.

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
You can go to the plugin documentation.

88
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,880
So once you are done with this, you can terminate your Jenkins server.

89
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:12,330
In the next project, we will create Jenkins next.

90
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:14,880
So all the servers once again.

91
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,310
So I recommend you terminate this instance.

92
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,200
So that was some quick view on the Jenkins pipeline.

93
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,850
We'll see this much in detail in the next project.

94
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:33,040
So wrap this up and join me in the next project.
