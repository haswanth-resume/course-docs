1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:06,540
I'm in my management console and I will be going to easy to service.

2
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:13,190
I will launch when?

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:14,390
Easy to instance.

4
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,880
Where I will run the Jenkins service.

5
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:21,990
If you already have a Jenkins service running, you can use the same one.

6
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:27,210
If not, just follow me and launch when you see instance with Jenkins service.

7
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,930
Let's first get all the steps of installing Jenkins.

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:35,280
Open a text editor and write down these steps.

9
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,530
Forced sudo apt.

10
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:41,370
Update.

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,190
So we'll be using Ubuntu 22 instance and we'll be running app command to install jenkins and few other

12
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:51,410
tools after that.

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:55,330
Sudo apt install open key.

14
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,420
Oops.

15
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,490
Hyphen eat hyphen.

16
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,980
JDC, hyphen y.

17
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,060
And.

18
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,770
Sudo apt install maven hyphen y.

19
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,960
Make sure you have the installation command first and then maven.

20
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,860
Don't change the order or don't mix into one command.

21
00:01:15,590 --> 00:01:18,110
Then we'll get the steps of installing Jenkins.

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:23,860
So I just google install Jenkins installing Jenkins the Jenkins dot IO.

23
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:25,850
Linux.

24
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,160
Debian ubuntu.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,160
Make sure you are in this documentation.

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,050
The steps might change whatever steps you see.

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:36,420
Use the same step.

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,850
Copy all this command.

29
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,110
Hyphen y.

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,800
So wherever you have install an get install or APT install, just make sure you put a hyphen y and at

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:57,800
the beginning of this file, just write this hash, exclamation slash bin bash.

32
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,070
I will show you how we are going to run all these commands.

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,500
So let's go to Easy to Dashboard.

34
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,180
Let's say launch instance.

35
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,949
Launch instance.

36
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:12,550
We'll call it as Jenkins server.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,980
Let's put a hyphen there.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,340
And we will go with open to and we'll select open to 21 to 23 tier eligible.

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,390
Make sure you select that one and not any other.

40
00:02:25,390 --> 00:02:26,720
Open to 20 I.

41
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,060
Scroll down instance typed e to micro will be fine.

42
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:33,410
Let's create a key pair.

43
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:42,680
We'll give this name as Jenkins key and keep it pem file because I will be using get batch to login.

44
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:50,020
Okay, come down creating the security group.

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,680
We will go to edit in the network setting.

46
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:57,220
Call it as Jenkins hyphen sg.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:08,670
Type some description there 22 allowed from my IP and add one more rule which sees port 8080 allowed

48
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:10,290
from my IP.

49
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,840
Jenkins will run its web service on Port 88.

50
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:18,990
So we need to allow that rule 88 from my IP so we can access Jenkins on Port 88.

51
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,440
Scroll down.

52
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,080
Go to advanced details.

53
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:28,220
Come till the end and open your text editor where you have written all the commands.

54
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,400
Select copy and paste it there.

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,230
Make sure the first line is this.

56
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,920
Otherwise, this commands will not run.

57
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,010
Yeah.

58
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,540
And let's say launch instance.

59
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,820
View all instances.

60
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:49,590
So this will take some time.

61
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:53,720
I will pause my screen and come back when this is ready.

62
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,690
Okay, let's access it on Port 88.

63
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:09,510
Copy the public IP access on Port 88 and it should ask you to open this file and enter the password

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,350
from that file.

65
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,080
So we need to do a search to the Jenkins.

66
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:17,100
Again, copy the IP open get bash.

67
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,560
This is such hype and I downloads Jenkins key.

68
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,280
Want to add the rate and pace the IP.

69
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,420
To pseudo hyphen i.

70
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,540
Clear the screen.

71
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:41,320
Cat and let's copy the file name.

72
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:43,900
That file is.

73
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,740
Copy that.

74
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,230
And that you have the unlocked password.

75
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:51,130
Copy that.

76
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:51,940
Password.

77
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,200
In pasted here.

78
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,790
Continue.

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,140
We will see install suggested plugins, click on that.

80
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:05,930
A username I'll give as admin.

81
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,640
And then some password.

82
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,000
Full name and email address.

83
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,300
I will say I'd been at mail dot com save and continue.

84
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,100
See when finish.

85
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,570
Start using Jenkins.

86
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:27,640
Okay.

87
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,140
We need to install some plugins.

88
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,990
The task that we are going to execute after this.

89
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:37,500
We need those plugins, so you need to click on Manage Jenkins.

90
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,000
And go to manage plugins.

91
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,580
And click on available.

92
00:05:45,140 --> 00:05:46,910
And a search for.

93
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,790
Pipeline here.

94
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,590
Pipe line.

95
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,150
If you come down, you will see pipeline utility steps.

96
00:05:56,170 --> 00:06:02,440
Click on that checkmark on that and pipeline MAVEN integration check mark on that.

97
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,460
And this is fine.

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:07,740
Let's click on install without restart.

99
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:15,190
Okay, those plugins are installed.

100
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,940
Now we can start writing our pipeline code and execute some job on a Jenkins.

101
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:29,130
Now pipeline is really text, so you can use any text editor to write the pipeline.

102
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,210
I'm going to use Intel.

103
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,450
You can use a text, notepad, notepad, plus plus voice code, anything that you prefer.

104
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:41,910
Later in the project you will see we are going to use voice code or intel.

105
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,120
But now you can use anything you want.

106
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,730
So let's open the text editor.

107
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,020
So I'll use intelligence.

108
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,570
You can really use anything to write Pipeline.

109
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:35,560
If you're supposed to put this into the motion control system, then you should create a file with named

110
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,820
Jenkins file.

111
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,030
But I'm going to just execute it from the Jenkins job.

112
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,790
So it doesn't matter what I name over here.

113
00:07:43,410 --> 00:07:47,760
But if you're putting it in your project source code, then it should be with this name.

114
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,030
J.

115
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:49,620
Capital Jenkins file.

116
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:54,270
First thing is you see pipeline calibrates.

117
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,270
Indentation does not matter.

118
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,390
But it's good to do because it looks good.

119
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,090
Agent I'm saying.

120
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:07,880
Agent Any I want to execute it on any node.

121
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,590
Master slave does not matter.

122
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,340
And then I'll see.

123
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,350
Stages.

124
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,040
In stages.

125
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,570
I have different stage.

126
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:27,620
And you see stage and you give parentheses and then you can give the name of the state.

127
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:32,299
So I'm going to say fetch code.

128
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,169
And open, close curly braces.

129
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,510
And in this, you have steps that will do the actual execution.

130
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:54,000
If you want to fetch the source code from the pipeline, then you can say git branch.

131
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,070
So it is going to invoke your git plugin.

132
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:00,230
And then you mentioned the branch name.

133
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,910
Now I'm saying.

134
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:07,550
So there is a branch in our repository with pipeline as a code named P.

135
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:13,940
You can check that the Jenkins file already exists over there, but we will not be using that Jenkins

136
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:14,150
file.

137
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,650
We'll be writing our own file.

138
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:19,210
You are allow for repository in single code.

139
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:25,680
If I execute this, it should fetch the source code.

140
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,970
But then we want to do something with the source code.

141
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:31,770
So we'll write another stage.

142
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:32,890
Stage?

143
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,800
Inequalities build.

144
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:44,910
And you step.

145
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,100
Steps.

146
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:58,300
So if you want to execute Shell command, you can just say as such and in single or double code, you

147
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,900
can give the command that you want to execute, I want to say and install.

148
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,750
So that's our second stage.

149
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,440
Let's write one more stage.

150
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:12,540
Will give the stage name as test.

151
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,660
Steps.

152
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:29,620
And I'll see Shell execute and even test for me.

153
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,440
Okay, so we have three stages.

154
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:36,250
First stage is going to fetch the source code by using the gate plugin.

155
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,730
Second stage is build, which is going to run a step shell command and then install.

156
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,530
Third stage name test is going to run, right?

157
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,500
Is going to run.

158
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,710
One more step a shell command and we in test.

159
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:54,150
So let's copy this.

160
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:57,080
And let's go to Jenkins.

161
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,340
So we'll create a new item.

162
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:02,820
We'll give a name.

163
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:15,010
Sample pipeline as a code and you have to select here pipeline, not freestyle pipeline and say, okay.

164
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:20,340
Initially it may look similar, but if you come down, it's a different thing.

165
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:21,960
You have something called a pipeline.

166
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,260
There is no build or post build action over here.

167
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:31,560
You have just built triggers, some settings, and then finally the pipeline.

168
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,590
So you can pace your pipeline right over here.

169
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,330
That's one way.

170
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:40,410
Another way is you can say pipeline script from Seam.

171
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,650
You can select the source code manager.

172
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:50,160
For example, you can give the URL, you can give the branch, and then in your branch you should have

173
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,890
a file named as Jenkins File Capital.

174
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,390
I'll show you a sample.

175
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:02,340
So if you come to our source code GitHub repository, you can search for a C pipeline as a code.

176
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:03,860
At one.

177
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:08,780
And you see a file called Jenkins file if you click on it.

178
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,140
You should see the entire pipeline.

179
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,950
And there are a lot of things over here.

180
00:12:15,950 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll understand it.

181
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,080
Okay, so you should have Jenkins file in your top level directory.

182
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:32,000
But we are going to just say here pipeline script and we'll execute the script that we have written.

183
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,880
This is a declarative, again, not a scripted way.

184
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:39,590
If I'm saying scripting, scripting that just to tell you that we're not creating jobs manually, this

185
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,550
is a declarative way.

186
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:45,140
I'll also take you through the documentation of Jenkins pipeline as a code.

187
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:47,990
Now we can see if this.

188
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,800
And we can say build now.

189
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,510
Okay, now you should see stage view.

190
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,820
First stage is happening.

191
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,060
It is fetching the source code.

192
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:01,770
You can see the logs also there.

193
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,310
All right.

194
00:13:03,310 --> 00:13:04,870
That's little neat.

195
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,120
Then, Bill.

196
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:09,940
Belongs.

197
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,800
A good test is happening.

198
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,710
Logs.

199
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,970
You can see the logs.

200
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,230
Or you can see the entire log at once by going over here.

201
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,690
And you see a log of every stage, every step that is getting executed.

202
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,730
And it's a success.

203
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:45,040
If you're wondering where is workspace, then every build will have its own workspace.

204
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,680
So you click on this build ID.

205
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,130
And scroll down these workspaces.

206
00:13:52,580 --> 00:14:00,690
And you can see as a workspace sample pipeline is a code and you see all the data build the source code.

207
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,630
So you should see the artifact as well.

208
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,710
If you're wondering, there's too much of data in this Jenkins file.

209
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:15,160
Don't worry this documentation for that and we can check it over from there.

210
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:22,390
And also every plugin that you have used or you want to use will have a documentation to how to write

211
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,710
it in your Jenkins file.

212
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:27,530
So let's go to the documentation.
