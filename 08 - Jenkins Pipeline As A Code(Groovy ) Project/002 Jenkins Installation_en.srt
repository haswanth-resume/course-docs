1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:07,120
I'm in a management console and we're going to launch an easy two instance and install Jenkins on that.

2
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,450
So let's see the installation steps.

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,060
So search for Jenkins documentation.

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,230
You should find the link.

5
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,550
Jenkins dot IO.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,400
The Jenkins documentation has improved now a lot.

7
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:23,630
Let's see.

8
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,950
Installing Jenkins.

9
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:31,870
So the subchapter is you can set it up on Docker, Kubernetes, Linux.

10
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,290
So let's see Linux.

11
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:41,480
So in Linux you have one two Fedora Red Hat and they're prerequisites and it's really very minimum.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:46,190
We need really minimum one GB of RAM and some disk space.

13
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,880
So easy to instance should be fine for us the two micro.

14
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,330
So these are the steps for ubuntu installation.

15
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,880
Let's copy all this commands.

16
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,420
That's open text editor.

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,080
I will be using Sublime.

18
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:04,379
You can use Notepad, Notepad plus plus anything.

19
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:07,190
Let's paste all these commands.

20
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,120
At the end where you see app get installed.

21
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,950
Jenkins Just put a hyphen y.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,470
Go at the top.

23
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:21,250
So these are the steps of installing Jenkins, but we also have some dependencies that we will be installing.

24
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:28,450
So for starts with sudo apt update and even before that we have to give this line hash, exclamation

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,270
slash bin slash bash.

26
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:35,020
Keep in mind if you don't give that line, we will be running it from user data.

27
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:41,830
If you don't give this line, this these commands or the script will not run from easy to user data.

28
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:47,740
We need to install jdc sudo apt install open.

29
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:53,120
JDK hyphen 11 hyphen jdc oops.

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,260
JDC hyphen y.

31
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,700
So now Jenkins doesn't support to run on JDK eight.

32
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:02,280
So we are going with JDK 11.

33
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:09,990
Next, we will also install MAVEN app, install maven hyphen VI so we can run our builds.

34
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,890
But I will be skipping this command for now.

35
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,760
We will see what happens if we do not install the correct tools, what errors we get, and how do we

36
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,280
fix it.

37
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,210
We'll see that.

38
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,380
So these are all the commands to install Jenkins.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:31,710
Let's copy all this and let's go to our easy to console.

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,660
Let's see.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,770
Launch instance.

42
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,540
We'll call it as Jenkins server.

43
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,170
One two.

44
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,280
You have to select here open to 20 and be very careful.

45
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,300
Open to 23 tier eligible this one and not any other.

46
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,350
Open to 20.

47
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,280
Okay, scroll down now.

48
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,990
We can we will start with t to micro, but if you see your Jenkins instance becomes unresponsive, then

49
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,300
you may need to increase its instance type from PT to micro to t to small.

50
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,290
I'm going to directly go with PT to Small here.

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,380
Keep it.

52
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,970
We will create a key pair.

53
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:25,680
They create new key pair and I will call it as Jenkins hyphen key.

54
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:30,240
Make sure the PEM file is selected here and they create key pair.

55
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:33,740
Let's save this.

56
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,470
Make sure the Jenkins key is selected there.

57
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,120
In the network setting, click on Edit.

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,190
We will create our own security group.

59
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:52,920
So select create new security group and give the name as Jenkins S.G. hyphen there.

60
00:03:56,520 --> 00:04:07,050
So we need to allow rule as a search 22 from my IP and then add another rule which is 80 sorry, 8080

61
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,130
from my IP now 22.

62
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,279
So we can do such and 88, so we can access it from the browser.

63
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:21,149
And once your work is done for today, you shut it down.

64
00:04:21,149 --> 00:04:24,570
Tomorrow you power on tomorrow, your public IP may change.

65
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:29,520
So you need to again come back to the security group of Jenkins and you have to say, edit rule and

66
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,080
my IP select again.

67
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,880
Your IP will change here.

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,940
Now in the advanced details, drop down, scroll down, go to user data, and let's copy your script

69
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,570
and paste it there.

70
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:48,060
A few things to verify.

71
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:54,130
Make sure hash exclamation bin bash is there and there is hyphen y wherever there is apt install command.

72
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:57,660
There's JDK 11.

73
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,660
And now let's launch this instance.

74
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,280
Click on that instance ID.

75
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,570
Okay.

76
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,000
After waiting for some time.

77
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,940
Let's check the user interface.

78
00:05:25,330 --> 00:05:27,520
And it's installed successfully.

79
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,760
If you don't get this page, check the security group or log into the Jenkins and check the installation

80
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,480
steps.

81
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:40,090
So we need to unlock Jenkins and in and this file has the unlock password.

82
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:41,950
So we log into Jenkins now.

83
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,770
As such, Logan.

84
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:57,350
So if your installation, your user data does not go through, maybe there could be something wrong

85
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:59,660
in your user data shell script.

86
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:04,580
So you can check that by running the command curl and this URL.

87
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:14,970
This URL girl and this URL, they should return the user data script there.

88
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,480
So if there is a mistake then no problem.

89
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:21,570
You can run these commands manually one by one.

90
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,490
Let's check the status.

91
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,380
Sys CTL status.

92
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,180
Jenkins.

93
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,360
So Jenkins is active running.

94
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,120
Let's hit queue quit from this.

95
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:41,010
So if you see it's not active and running, you should see the user data what it is.

96
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,310
If you made a mistake, then run all the commands manually.

97
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,740
Let me clear the screen.

98
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:52,480
So once the Jenkins is installed, its home directory will be this var lib.

99
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,160
Jenkins.

100
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,420
So this is the home directory of Jenkins.

101
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:04,590
All the data of Jenkins will be in this directory, and this password file is also in the same directory.

102
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:06,510
Let's check the password.

103
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,040
That's the unlocked password.

104
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:11,840
So it will be random.

105
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,490
It will be different for every one.

106
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,550
Space the password and continue.

107
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:26,470
Okay, so Jenkins main powerhouse are its plug ins, huge collection of plug ins.

108
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:31,000
And Jenkins has so many popular plug ins, which Jenkins suggests that you should be installing that.

109
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,120
Or you can also select from the popular plug ins.

110
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,850
So lets select plug ins to install.

111
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:43,850
Now these are some popular plugins that you can go with and you have different section organization

112
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,290
and and administration.

113
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:46,970
You have these popular plugins.

114
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,620
Then you have build features plugin and this you have SSH agent.

115
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,770
So wherever it's checkmark, that plugin will be installed.

116
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,860
Build tool like maybe we don't want ADD and we want node.js.

117
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,140
So Jenkins is running on a Linux machine, so we will not be able to use RMS build.

118
00:08:06,170 --> 00:08:13,490
But if you integrate Jenkins master with a Windows slave node, then we can run Windows build also.

119
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,890
We'll be seeing that in master slave concept.

120
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,140
Popular build analysis and reporting tools like Cobertura G-Unit.

121
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,820
So go through this list.

122
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:26,350
Check and uncheck a few.

123
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,440
Doesn't matter, really.

124
00:08:27,460 --> 00:08:29,830
We are going to install plug in manually also.

125
00:08:30,190 --> 00:08:33,370
Whenever the need comes, we'll find the right plugin and install them.

126
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,520
So I'm just going to say install.

127
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,840
And wait for few minutes till the installation is completed.

128
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,380
Time to set a user.

129
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,650
I'll set a user named admin and it will give some password to it.

130
00:08:54,260 --> 00:08:58,040
You can set any user you want, that user will have full access.

131
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:09,160
Let's see when continue.

132
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:16,380
So at the time of installation, the Jenkins IP address is this.

133
00:09:17,170 --> 00:09:20,890
So that is going to record in the Jenkins Earl.

134
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:27,330
And I want you to remember this because easy to instance that we are using is having dynamic IP.

135
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:31,210
You shut down and then you power on its IP will change.

136
00:09:31,450 --> 00:09:37,750
That will not affect in accessing the Jenkins but there are a few places where we'll be using Jenkins

137
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:43,090
Earl or Jenkins will be using its own URL and that URL may be older one.

138
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,190
We'll see how to fix it when we get that problem.

139
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:49,480
But keep this in mind regarding your easy to instance.

140
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:52,600
If you need a static IP, then go for elastic IP.

141
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:55,180
But for learning purpose it should be fine.

142
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,710
Save and finish.

143
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,600
Start using Jenkins.

144
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,450
And it says Welcome to Jenkins.

145
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,230
Nice.

146
00:10:08,230 --> 00:10:09,760
A new and better UI.

147
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:11,630
Okay.

148
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:14,870
So the first step you see here is creating a job.

149
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,490
And that's what we'll do first.
