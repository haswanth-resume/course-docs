1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,210
All right.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:04,540
So we will be creating our first job.

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:06,220
It will be a build job.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,380
So before we run our job, before we create and run our job, we need to make sure we have JDK eight

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:17,710
and MAVEN in the Jenkins.

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:19,600
And I will show you how to do that.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:22,630
You need to go to manage Jenkins.

8
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,770
Global tool configuration.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,730
From here we can configure the tools that Jenkins will use.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:36,040
There is JDK installation and if you scroll down you should see here Maven.

11
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,680
So first lets click on Add JDK.

12
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,360
And we are going to give here a name.

13
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,490
Oracle, JDK eight.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:49,510
You can give any name, but whatever name you give, make sure you remember it.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,380
And just to be on the safer side, just use the same name I'm using.

16
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,150
This is just a name here.

17
00:00:55,150 --> 00:00:58,750
We have to select what version of Java will be installed.

18
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,020
Now this is one way of installing a JDK.

19
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:09,010
You select here the JDK eight and you will get here an option to enter the username and password of

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:09,850
Oracle.

21
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,830
You can create an Oracle account and then put a checkmark and that is it.

22
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,030
You can use it.

23
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,060
But the problem recently, we're having a lot of problems with this.

24
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:24,280
Jenkins is not able to download this JDK from Oracle account.

25
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:26,000
So we're going to do this.

26
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,000
We are not going to do this install automatically.

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,740
We're going to uncheck that option.

28
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:31,480
Uncheck this option.

29
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:39,130
It should be unchecked and we will install a JDK from the command line and then specify its path over

30
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,640
here.

31
00:01:39,970 --> 00:01:44,530
So all you need to do is just switch to the Jenkins instance.

32
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:49,930
So let's copy its public IP and let's do an search to it.

33
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,940
As I said, chive and I downloads.

34
00:01:56,780 --> 00:02:01,700
So whatever key you have with the Jenkins, specify that and do a search.

35
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,470
Yes.

36
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,729
Okay, so we just need to run two commands.

37
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,979
One is sudo apt update.

38
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:18,620
And a sudo apt install open.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,040
JDK hyphen eight hyphen JDK.

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:29,330
So we already have JDK 11 in this Jenkins For our project, we need JDK eight.

41
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,650
So we're installing JDK.

42
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:36,250
So you have to JDK in the Jenkins, JDK 11 and JDK eight.

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,410
So but if you run the command Java hyphen version.

44
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,980
You should see JDK or Java 11 being used, and that is fine.

45
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,180
Jenkins runs on that.

46
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,050
That is okay.

47
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:51,190
So how does in the tools we specify JDK eight.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,510
So I'll show you.

49
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:59,420
So the hyphen I Ellis user lib jvm oops.

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,930
User lib JVM.

51
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:06,190
So you see in this we have two folders here.

52
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,590
One is Java 1.8 and one is Java 11.

53
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:12,260
So if you're multiple versions of Java, it's home.

54
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,190
Directories will be here.

55
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,730
So all we need to do is specify this path as the home directory.

56
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,590
So user lib JVM.

57
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:21,510
Slash.

58
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,590
And this one.

59
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,390
1.8.

60
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,460
Remember Java 1.8?

61
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,260
Not 11.

62
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,980
Not anything else.

63
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,180
Just this one.

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,340
Get this spot.

65
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:36,990
And then we go back here and we just paste the part over here.

66
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:40,950
So specifying that this is the Java home directory that you need to use.

67
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,300
So this is open JDK and I have given here name as Oracle JDK.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:52,110
That is because later we will be using in our code the name as Oracle JDK eight with whatever you give

69
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:57,300
over here, make sure you remember that or you can come back and check the name so you can specify the

70
00:03:57,300 --> 00:04:00,390
correct name of the tool that you're using in your code.

71
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,280
But for now, this is this.

72
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:07,580
Just install open JDK and specify its path over here.

73
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,340
That is all.

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:09,380
Scroll down.

75
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,380
Scroll down.

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:15,820
Go to MAVEN section, click on Add Maven and this is pretty simple.

77
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:21,100
You just give the Maven name, so I will give here Maven.

78
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,500
Maven three.

79
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,540
And to select whatever three version it is there.

80
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,400
And that's all save.

81
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,650
Let's go to Dashboard.

82
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:39,980
Now, Jenkins did not actually install these tools.

83
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:44,030
When you run the build job that time, whenever it needs that time, it will install.

84
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:51,080
So we'll see in the next lecture how to create a job and use the tools that we just added.
