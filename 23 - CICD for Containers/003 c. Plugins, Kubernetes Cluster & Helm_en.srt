1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,350
How Jenkins should be up.

2
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:03,640
Let's try to log in.

3
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:08,940
And we are in.

4
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,690
This is fine.

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,040
We can log out from here.

6
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,930
Let's go to a browser.

7
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:16,270
Let's refresh the Jenkins page.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:32,950
I recommend you have Jenkins of TX to small minimum TX to micro will run very slow, so make sure you

9
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,540
have Jenkins TX to small.

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,790
Do you do?

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:38,400
My cross should also run, but it will be a little slower.

12
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:42,490
Next, we'll create the Kubernetes cluster from cops.

13
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,040
But before that, let's install a few plugins.

14
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,470
So let's go to manage Jenkins.

15
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,940
Manage plugins.

16
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,230
Available.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,350
We need the Docker plugin.

18
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:02,370
So a Docker pipeline and a Docker plugin.

19
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,520
And we'll also need the pipeline utility.

20
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,360
Pipeline and utility steps.

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,120
This is for Jenkins pipeline as a code.

22
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:26,300
Sort of put a checkmark on all these three plugins, Docker Pipeline, Docker and pipeline utility steps

23
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,460
and say install without a restart.

24
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,810
All right, While this is happening, let's log into our cops.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,980
Easy, to instance.

26
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:39,210
From here, we're going to create Kubernetes cluster.

27
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,240
So in my history, I already have the command to create the Kubernetes cluster.

28
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,350
I'm going to create it with the same name.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,910
I'm going to use the same bucket.

30
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:08,580
You can use exactly the same setup as you did in Cuba in this setup project.

31
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,800
Zones.

32
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,570
Zones.

33
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,800
We are changing.

34
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:16,100
We are running it currently.

35
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:20,450
I'm running it currently in Oregon region, so I'm going to give write zone names.

36
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:27,910
US west to a and us vest to be.

37
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,530
I'll use these two zones.

38
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,050
Node.

39
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:37,820
Count two is fine.

40
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:44,330
T2 Micro should be fine master size due to micro fine and the same DNS zone name.

41
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,420
Let's hit enter.

42
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,760
Cops Update Cluster.

43
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,790
We should actually create the cluster.

44
00:03:11,670 --> 00:03:16,140
So the creation process started and as we know, it's going to take some time.

45
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:21,210
By the time we will install Helme in this copse issue, for instance.

46
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:24,000
So let's go to helm documentation.

47
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,620
Helm search.

48
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:40,220
So there is no plugin that I could found and I did not find any plugin of Helme in Jenkins.

49
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,180
But maybe by the time you're watching the video you should find some plugin.

50
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:47,070
But anyways, you don't need that help plugin.

51
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:53,300
We are going to add the corpse issue two instance as a slave to Jenkins and will run Helm command.

52
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:56,600
From cops itself.

53
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:58,600
So we really don't need that plugin.

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:03,200
V but need to install help in this instance.

55
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,690
So let's go to documentation.

56
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,310
So if you don't know about helm, Hell basically is a packaging system for definition files.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:22,540
We can package our entire all the definitions for our project stack and we can also deploy to cover

58
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:23,480
this cluster.

59
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:29,660
So instead of managing all the definition file for deployment service volumes, all the different different

60
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,660
definition file, we maintain and manage separately.

61
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,200
Instead of that, we can use Helm to package all of them and run them or update them on Kubernetes cluster.

62
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:47,650
So it is Helme helps you manage Kubernetes Application Help Charts.

63
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:55,150
Charts are actually the collection of our definition files, so we can define everything by using charts.

64
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,750
If you want to learn a few more things about Helm, you can check the Quick Start guide.

65
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:01,490
You can check the architecture of Helm.

66
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:04,010
And there's a small interaction video as well.

67
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:10,730
There's so many things in helm, but to get started with we, we can create the package in helm and

68
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,190
we can deploy our application by using Helm.

69
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,610
Let's go to get started.

70
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,020
So political sites.

71
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,610
We need a communist cluster.

72
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:23,400
We should already have all the security configuration.

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,620
It is saying installing and configuring Helme.

74
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,120
So let's install helme.

75
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,170
So let's go to the official release page.

76
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:37,660
We can do it through home rules of your MacBook, but we're installing it on a Linux instance.

77
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,270
Let's check the installation guide.

78
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:49,870
So we just need to download the binary, extract it and put it to use our local bin held pot.

79
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,080
So let's download that.

80
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,170
The latest one will go with.

81
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,540
So Linux aimed 64.

82
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,690
That should be fine.

83
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:05,850
Is it a download link?

84
00:06:05,850 --> 00:06:06,720
Let's check it.

85
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:11,440
Yeah, that's a download link.

86
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,250
Let's copy it.

87
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,600
Copy link, address.

88
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:16,240
Let's go to a COPS instance.

89
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,370
So downloaded Helme.

90
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:28,770
I'm going to extract it our exit.

91
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,070
V.

92
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,790
F.

93
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:30,810
L.

94
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:35,740
Should have Linux aimed 64 directory.

95
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,270
So we have this binary we are going to move it to.

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,400
Move.

97
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,830
Hell, yeah.

98
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:49,870
We're going to move it to use our local bin.

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,500
The name?

100
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,100
Same name.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,600
Helm.

102
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,060
And let's see if we can access helm.

103
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,350
Hyphen hyphen help.

104
00:06:58,530 --> 00:06:59,460
Yes.

105
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,630
Okay, so we have this set up now.

106
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:07,250
We are going to prepare our repository with all the data.

107
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:09,570
We'll create charts in that.

108
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:12,020
We'll have the Docker file and the Jenkins file.

109
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:18,230
Before that, let's check whether we have our COVID cluster up or not.

110
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,210
It's up and running.

111
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,610
So we'll prepare the repository next.
