1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,810
Next we have to talk about AWS.

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:09,700
We are going to create a free tier account on AWS and also do some changes on that.

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,130
Like we will create an IAM user with multi-factor authentication, we will set a billing alarm.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:22,060
So in case accidently, if you use any expensive service or if you have kept your resources that you have not

5
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:24,790
cleaned, then we should get bills.

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,420
So as soon as a bills are spiking, we should get an alarm.

7
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,920
We should get a notification.

8
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,420
And finally, we're going to create a certificate.

9
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,620
From AWS ACM service, Amazon Certificate Managers Service which will be used for https, secure connection.

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:42,860
Secure connection.

11
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,440
So let's get started with AWS.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:51,940
All right, so just search for AWS free tier and you will find some links.

13
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,850
This one, Free Cloud Computing Services.

14
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:55,930
Click on this.

15
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:04,239
And AWS has created some really nice video explaining you what is free tier and how do you use it?

16
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:08,960
And also to check if you are exceeding year limit.

17
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,550
So I recommend you take your time and watch these videos.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:21,900
But in short, I will tell you we are  creating aws free tier account so we can use AWS cloud computing

19
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,010
without paying.

20
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:26,690
Anything or paying little bit of amount.

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:33,320
Now I see a little bit of amount because we will be crossing our free tier limit in some of projects.

22
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:41,710
And when we do that, I am going to alert you. Now since this is a complete hands on course and we will

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:43,720
be seeing many production use cases.

24
00:01:43,750 --> 00:01:46,450
Obviously, we need to go more than free tier.

25
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:51,380
But that would be very minimum, and you really don't need to worry about it.

26
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,970
We will be also setting billing alarms so if we get any bills.

27
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,930
We will get a notification and we can clean our resources.

28
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,020
So I would say just create the free tier account.

29
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:07,060
Let's click on create a free account.

30
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,490
First giving up the email address.

31
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,740
So that's what I am giving.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:15,990
I am now DevOps.

33
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:19,470
Make sure this email address exists because we need to verify this.

34
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,870
Do not use any fake details here.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:26,670
You can give an account name, so I'm just going to give the same name.

36
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:29,390
I am now dev ops.

37
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:32,480
And let's see.

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,770
Verify email address.

39
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:38,000
So let's get the verification code.

40
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:39,360
Okay.

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,850
So I got the verification code in my inbox and I am going to just paste it there.

42
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,610
Verify.

43
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,240
Next is root user password.

44
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:57,630
Make sure it is longer and it contains alphanumeric character and even symbols.

45
00:02:59,250 --> 00:03:03,550
And if you say you cannot remember such password, then use password managers.

46
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,280
There are many online available.

47
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:08,740
But really do not give a simple password.

48
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,280
This is going to be your public cloud account.

49
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:14,330
So be careful with this.

50
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:16,570
Okay.

51
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:21,850
Next personal account you go to select and fill in all this detail.

52
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,880
I will quickly fill this and go to the next step.

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,200
Okay.

54
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,830
Next comes the card detail.

55
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,360
You can use credit or debit card.

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,060
And let me tell you, if it's a debit card, Indian debit card, it will detect â‚¹2.

57
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:42,280
And for international call it is going to use $1 which is mentioned over here.

58
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,540
This is verification and it is just to verify your identity.

59
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:47,170
Do not worry.

60
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,690
It is not going to take any money from your account.

61
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,300
As long as we are in free tier and we keep our account clean, we won't see any bills or very, very

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,200
minute bill.

63
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,410
So I will fill in all this detail and go to the next step.

64
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,970
Okay, next comes verification of your phone number.

65
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:11,050
So give you a phone number and get an estimate and verify this.

66
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:13,730
Okay.

67
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:16,190
Then comes next support plan.

68
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,930
So we are really going to use basic support free.

69
00:04:22,540 --> 00:04:29,230
When you're working for a project, there is a chance that the company would have taken a business support.

70
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:36,590
And I can tell you many of the places I have seen people are not even using the regular support, even

71
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,400
if they have plans.

72
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:44,360
So check when you're working on a project, if you have a support and if you get into issues with AWS

73
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:47,900
or Google Cloud or Azure, anything in check if they have support.

74
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:51,380
And you can directly talk to the tech support team anyway.

75
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:56,410
And that is for later part, let's just select basic support for now and see complete sign up.

76
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,860
All right.

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,080
Congratulations.

78
00:04:59,090 --> 00:04:59,330
It says

79
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:01,130
And we say thank you.

80
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,920
Let's go to the AWS Management Console.

81
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:06,600
Okay.

82
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,240
Let's see.

83
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,280
Sign in to console.

84
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,520
So this will be your very regular page to log into a console.

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,890
And this account is called a root user account.

86
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:25,880
So whenever I use the word root user, AWS root user, that means this account which you use to sign

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,900
sign up for AWS.

88
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,760
So let's say next.

89
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:30,870
All right.

90
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,470
captcha.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,540
Password.

92
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:36,960
Okay.

93
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,310
Now, let me take a pause here and talk about this.

94
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:43,120
AWS is now offering a new console.

95
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,270
That means the UI, the website, this console is getting updated and this happens very regularly.

96
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,260
It's really difficult to keep updating video simultaneously with the new console.

97
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,840
So you see new console now and a few months you will see a few new things and you it just keep on happening.

98
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:10,250
That's not a big concern because the features and services that I'm showing you in the video will be

99
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,140
same, but the UI will be different.

100
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:12,590
So.

101
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:20,680
I will be constantly updating the course, but then there will be a chance where I will be lagging.

102
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,010
Or like me, many of the instructors are facing this problem.

103
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,450
But that is really not a serious concern for you because UI will be different.

104
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:31,210
The settings, the features will be same.

105
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:35,600
So we just need to click instead of left, maybe need to click on right or maybe just need to look a

106
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:36,730
little bit more.

107
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,740
Well, let me tell you, I'll be constantly updating the video so you will have minimal problems.

108
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,300
So let's switch to new console home.

109
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:46,190
Okay.

110
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:51,080
So as we are now in, we will check whether our account is really active or not.

111
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,260
And for that I recommend a small test you will see ec2 hear, which is a virtual machine service

112
00:06:59,260 --> 00:06:59,920
or from here.

113
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,330
Also you can search for service.

114
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,230
EC2.

115
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:04,760
And you can click on this.

116
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,180
And if you get a screen like I'm getting like instance zero, everything zero.

117
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,820
And you see the details over here.

118
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,990
That means our account is active, it's enabled.

119
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:23,080
Otherwise you will get some errors over here which will be like verify your phone or card or something

120
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:23,490
like that.

121
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:25,480
Click on that and you verify the details.

122
00:07:25,930 --> 00:07:31,180
And if you think everything you have verified, still your account is not active, it is showing errors,

123
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,450
then you check with the support team.

124
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:35,770
So you go to.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:42,540
There, support center and you create a ticket and you can chat also with them.

126
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:43,680
You give them the details.

127
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,030
My account is not active.

128
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,750
They will immediately activate it or maybe take a little bit of time.

129
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:50,650
Okay.

130
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:57,100
Now, since we have our account, let's quickly do a few very important things, starting with creating

131
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:57,820
a user.

132
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:05,560
The user that we logged in is a root user and I do not recommend using a root user to use AWS services.

133
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:11,380
We are going to create another user called as just IAM user so find IAM service.

134
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:11,980
Click on it.

135
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:15,000
Okay.

136
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,060
So the first thing we see here is security recommendation.

137
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,760
It says Add MFA for root user.

138
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,490
MFA is multi-factor authentication.

139
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:28,560
So basically you will have a software installed on your phone.

140
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:35,710
Which is Google authenticator and it is going to show you six digit code and every time you need to enter

141
00:08:35,710 --> 00:08:37,450
that along with your password.

142
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:41,220
Just like your OTP, SMS based.

143
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:46,440
This is going to be OTP with Google Authenticator, so we will do that first.

144
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,910
Very important, Add MFA.

145
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,210
And it says Activate MFA, click on this button, see virtual MFA device and continue.

146
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,730
And it will show a QR code.

147
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,600
You need to install Google Authenticator on your phone.

148
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:12,260
Which is something like this, and you just click on add here and scan the barcode and you will get

149
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,980
a six digit number here which gets refreshed every 30 seconds.

150
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:18,380
So I will do that on my phone quickly.

151
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:21,460
Okay.

152
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,080
I just did it.

153
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:29,820
And you need to enter the MFA code that you get on your app and wait for 32nd it gets refreshed, then

154
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,240
enter the second one and just say Assign MFA.

155
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:35,250
Okay.

156
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,150
That is done.

157
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:39,230
Now we'll go to Dashboard.

158
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,460
Okay.

159
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:43,220
So this is all green.

160
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:45,380
Let's go to users. Now

161
00:09:45,410 --> 00:09:48,710
We will be using and I am user I will say add user.

162
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:56,290
Now I will give my username as admin or I will see it admin.

163
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,720
And you have to select your password.

164
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:05,060
Now, there are two types of access types to access types.

165
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,270
One is console, which is through the browser.

166
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,710
Console means even new access to the browser.

167
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,480
Basically that's called aws console and another one is programmatic access.

168
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:22,300
This is going to be, we will be using this when we use AWS CLI or when we use automation.

169
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:30,080
Like when you use Ansible or TerraForm to access AWS resources, then we are going to use this.

170
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:31,640
For now, do not use this.

171
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,420
And.

172
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,390
One more alert over here.

173
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,620
Access keys.

174
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,660
Secret keys are very, very dangerous.

175
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,540
If you are not careful with them.

176
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,570
So remember this for your life.

177
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,930
If you have access, key and secret key, keep it very, very safe.

178
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,700
Do not post them on public repository or public places.

179
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,780
Make sure nobody has access to it except you.

180
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,000
Because if it is publicly available, it will be immediately hacked and there'll be immediate bitcoin

181
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,160
mining starting in your account.

182
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:12,160
And you will see huge bills.

183
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:14,490
It's a big problem when you're working in projects.

184
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,570
If it's your free your personal account.

185
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,470
There'll be some limits to it.

186
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:23,340
It cannot go more than a certain limit and AWS will alert you.

187
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:27,690
But for projects, business accounts, you will have unlimited.

188
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,880
Access and so as the hacker will also have.

189
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,780
So if bitcoin mining if not that, then there will be ransom.

190
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,150
And it's very.

191
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:43,390
This one's very, very common hack that happens with AWS accounts, and it is only if we are

192
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,030
not careful.

193
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,580
Otherwise, it's very, very safe.

194
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:52,690
So for now, just go with console access, auto generate password, or you can say custom password and

195
00:11:52,690 --> 00:11:53,650
give your own password.

196
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,320
I'll just go with auto generate and this password will be reset when we log in with this.

197
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:59,650
So let's go next.

198
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:02,200
Attach existing policy now.

199
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:09,660
This is what makes it very dangerous or maybe useful policies are permissions for this user.

200
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,850
So I'm saying administrator access because we will use this user throughout the course to do many admin

201
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,210
work.

202
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:19,860
So we need this policy administrator access go next.

203
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:23,580
Next review create user.

204
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,020
So I have the username and password.

205
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:30,270
I'm going to download .csv file.

206
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:33,770
And that will contain username and password.

207
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:34,610
Let's close this.

208
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:38,210
Okay.

209
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:39,950
Along with this, we need to do also one more thing.

210
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,790
Let's go to Dashboard and we need to customize this link.

211
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:49,250
This is the link that we, the IAM user, will use to log into the account and it contains the account

212
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:54,740
ID and I'm going to create an alias instead of account ID so giving some name.

213
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,900
So I'll just see I am now DevOps, same name or you can give a different name.

214
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,220
So that will be the URL for the iam user to log into this account.

215
00:13:05,570 --> 00:13:06,410
save changes.

216
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay.

217
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,320
Next we will set up MFA for this user.

218
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,370
Also very important.

219
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,300
Go to this user.

220
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:16,970
Security credentials.

221
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,430
And will see assign MFA device.

222
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,260
And same process.

223
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:27,880
Okay.

224
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,070
Good.

225
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:33,970
Now our account is safe and we have an IAM  user and this user has administrative access permission and

226
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,320
you can add more permission.

227
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:41,620
I mean, administrator is the maximum, but if you want to create account for anybody else and you don't

228
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:46,630
want administrator access, you can change the access also like read access or a specific service access.

229
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,040
Okay, good.

230
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,180
Our account is safe.

231
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,750
Secure.

232
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:52,630
And this is from others.

233
00:13:53,410 --> 00:14:01,750
We also want to safeguard our account from our own actions, which is, irresponsibly

234
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:06,730
if you kept something ON for a very, very long time, you get huge bills and you should have a billing

235
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,060
alarm.

236
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:09,340
There are so many horror stories about that.

237
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:12,430
Even there are many memes floating on the Internet about this.

238
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,580
So if you kept something accidentally ON for a long time.

239
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:24,700
You can set a billing alarm and you get an email notification that your bill is crossing about certain

240
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,920
dollars and you can check.

241
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,660
And fix those things.

242
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:32,210
Now get for this one.

243
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:36,080
We will be going to, not here, this question mark.

244
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,160
Oops.

245
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:37,580
Sorry.

246
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:39,230
They have, they keep moving things.

247
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:45,160
We will go to the billing dashboard and click on Billing Dashboard.

248
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,690
So you can keep checking this.

249
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:51,810
I recommend, you know, before you go to sleep, just check your bills.

250
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,460
How much it is every night.

251
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:55,860
Or maybe once you wake up in the morning.

252
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,420
But I'm setting here.

253
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,300
Free tier alerts or billing alerts.

254
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:00,660
Sorry.

255
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:03,960
So here you have option billing preferences.

256
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:04,650
Click on that.

257
00:15:06,270 --> 00:15:12,180
And here, here select receive pdf invoice by email receive free tier usage alerts.

258
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:15,100
So if you cross your free tier, you will get alerts.

259
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,590
Let's give our email address there.

260
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,200
And receive billing alerts.

261
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,080
So select all these things.

262
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,220
save preference.

263
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:28,550
Okay.

264
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,610
Now let's click on this AWS logo here.

265
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:31,380
Let's go back.

266
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,520
And now you have to find a service called as Cloud Watch.

267
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:40,780
Cloud Watch is monitoring service.

268
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:43,790
We will be using this monitoring service in our course.

269
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,750
But right now we all we need to monitor is our bills.

270
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,910
And you need to be in this North Virginia region over here.

271
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:56,970
We will understand later what this region means.

272
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:59,540
But think of this as like a data center.

273
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,710
So you need to be here in North Virginia.

274
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,740
If you are somewhere else, make sure you select, north Virginia.

275
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,360
And we will go to alarms.

276
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:12,150
We click on all alarms.

277
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,120
And we will create alarm.

278
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:20,660
Select your metric on what you want to set the alarm.

279
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:25,390
You should see billing if you do not see billing.

280
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,880
Make sure you have put those checkmarks on and you are in North Virginia region.

281
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,940
Then only you will see this billing metric over here.

282
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:37,380
Click on that will set total estimated charge on that.

283
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:43,650
We want to set the alarm and we'll select the currency USD and select metric.

284
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,390
Now, you really do need to understand this.

285
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,300
now. We have a separate section for this one.

286
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:55,940
All you need to do is you go here and you say, let's say, five.

287
00:16:56,030 --> 00:17:02,150
So if I say five and my bill crosses more than $5, I will get email notification.

288
00:17:02,570 --> 00:17:02,800
Okay.

289
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:05,300
So you can set like that and you can say go next.

290
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,510
Now to set notification.

291
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:14,280
It uses a service called SNS Simple Notification Service.

292
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,640
We need to give our email address here so we do not have any sns topic.

293
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:26,400
SNS topic basically means there will be mostly an email address attached to the topic.

294
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:31,530
So we do not have any topic will create new topic and will give topic a name.

295
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,960
I will call this as let's say monitoring team.

296
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,350
We can give any name there and give the email address.

297
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,740
And say create  topic.

298
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:47,660
Now this topic will exist in North Virginia region.

299
00:17:47,670 --> 00:17:49,440
You can use it any time you want.

300
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,480
You can just select your topic and use it.

301
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:56,850
We will be using this later, for now, just billing alarms and just say next.

302
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,220
Give alarm a name

303
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,060
I just see billing alert.

304
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,060
.

305
00:18:03,570 --> 00:18:10,260
Or maybe AWS building alert, give something scary, but not too much scary.

306
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,580
Otherwise it will go to spam.

307
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,070
Yeah.

308
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:13,520
Let's go.

309
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:13,910
Next.

310
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,130
And this is all our settings and to create alarm.

311
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay.

312
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:21,580
So.

313
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,770
We need to confirm your email address.

314
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:27,090
So let's go to our inbox, Gmail inbox.

315
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:33,910
So I get this email in my Gmail because I have a Gmail account, confirm subscription.

316
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,570
Okay.

317
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:37,300
That's confirmed.

318
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:37,990
Let's go back.

319
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,870
And we need to wait for a moment.

320
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:44,670
Okay.

321
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:46,140
There's a refresh button over here.

322
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,160
You can keep trying that.

323
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:48,830
Okay.

324
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:51,620
After a minute or so I get to the status as, okay.

325
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:54,560
That is because my bill is less than $5.

326
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:58,700
When it goes more than $5, I get notification and here you should see alarm.

327
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:00,550
All right, good.

328
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,820
Three things knocked down, created the account, set IAM user with MFA and created billing alarm.

329
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:08,560
We're doing good.

330
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:09,670
One more last thing.

331
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,900
We need to create a public certificate for our domain.

332
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,520
We purchased a domain.

333
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:23,350
And we will use a certificate to validate the certificate with the domain.

334
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:29,620
But what that really means is you see here to https, any website you see a https, there is this lock

335
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:35,100
symbol or you click on that and you should see here this connection is secure.

336
00:19:35,110 --> 00:19:37,020
And how do you say it's a secure?

337
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:37,920
What's the guarantee?

338
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:38,320
So.

339
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:41,230
This has a valid certificate.

340
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:46,060
Now, when we set up our project, we will be also setting up HTTPS secure connection.

341
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:50,650
And what validates that is the certificate, which is tied to your domain.

342
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:54,250
So this certificate is tied to Amazon.com domain.

343
00:19:55,300 --> 00:20:00,940
Now click on this and you should see the certificates that this certificate is for this.

344
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:07,220
Certificate details, certification path, etc. Now.

345
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:10,590
If you do not understand anything.

346
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:12,220
Whatever I said about the certificate.

347
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:12,870
Do not worry.

348
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:13,890
We have the project.

349
00:20:13,890 --> 00:20:15,350
were we will we use it.

350
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:20,280
All you need to do is you need to go to the service called ACM Certificate Manager.

351
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:27,160
And remember the zone outside the region where you're creating the certificate.

352
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:32,200
Now we're creating a certificate from AWS itself and this one is going to be free.

353
00:20:32,650 --> 00:20:36,190
You can also purchase certificate from other providers also.

354
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,930
But we will keep it free.

355
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:43,300
So we said it was cert and will request a public certificate, go next.

356
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:51,120
And you need to give your domain name here and you have to say star dot your domain.

357
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,320
So I have a domain.

358
00:20:53,070 --> 00:20:54,120
k8s

359
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,540
k8sengineers.com

360
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,150
Make sure you're giving the right domain here.

361
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:06,100
I see many people are making typographical mistake in this one.

362
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:06,850
Be careful.

363
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,470
Give proper domain name.

364
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:15,900
And then how is this certificate validated with this domain that the certificate belongs to this domain?

365
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,900
How is it validated?

366
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:19,300
Well, we can do DNS validation.

367
00:21:19,690 --> 00:21:20,920
or  email validation.

368
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,200
DNS validation is quick, so give a name to the certificate we will say name.

369
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,070
I will say same thing k8s

370
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:29,650
This.

371
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,580
So I have multiple domains.

372
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:35,580
I have grroophy.in, k8sengineers and few other.

373
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:40,800
So I'm just showing you with this domain, whatever domain you purchased, give the correct name over

374
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,100
here.

375
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:41,600
k8sengineers.com

376
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:42,750
k8sengineers.com

377
00:21:44,170 --> 00:21:45,780
Like that, request.

378
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:49,770
Now for a moment, you won't see anything over here.

379
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:56,250
Just click on this refresh button and you should see there is a certificate I.D. and it is pending validation.

380
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:59,440
So it is not verified.

381
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,470
The way we verify this will click on this ID here.

382
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:03,790
Scroll down.

383
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:05,710
And you see here.

384
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,130
CNAME name

385
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,690
CNAME name

386
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:07,960
and CNAME Value

387
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,470
CNAME Value.

388
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,390
You need to create this record.

389
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:12,750
Where you created your domain.

390
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,580
So I created on GoDaddy.

391
00:22:15,030 --> 00:22:18,450
And I'm going to create this record over there.

392
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:22,020
If you still do not see this, refresh your page.

393
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:22,890
You will see that.

394
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,590
And now let me go to GoDaddy.

395
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,660
Okay.

396
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:34,660
So I go to my products and these are my two products two domain grouchy.in and k8sengineers I'm going

397
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,430
to go to k8sengineers.

398
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,650
I click here on Manage Domain.

399
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:41,950
Now, this UI may also change, so you just need to.

400
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:46,960
Manage DNS if you don't find the option as I am showing you would here.

401
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,130
Check with them or just search you will find it.

402
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,020
Go to manage DNS.

403
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,280
And you need to come over here.

404
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,210
DNS Records.

405
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:01,480
Now, DNS Records are basically mapping that for this IP address or for this name.

406
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,880
This is the IP address or for this name.

407
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,170
You have some other names.

408
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:11,060
For example I'll show you www maps to k8sengineers.com.

409
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,250
So that's one record like that.

410
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,990
We'll see how to create records later.

411
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,020
For now, what you need to do is you need to say ADD.

412
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,300
And you need to select here, CNAME.

413
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:25,450
And here you give the name, and here you give the value.

414
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,440
Okay.

415
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,910
So copy that.

416
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,560
That goes in the name.

417
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:33,840
Pasted there.

418
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:37,020
And just a moment.

419
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,630
I'm going to remove this full stop.

420
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:41,430
Okay.

421
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:43,920
Copy the value.

422
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,190
Paste it there again.

423
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:48,270
I'll remove this full stop.

424
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,930
And say add record.

425
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,390
Now when you click on add record, it will tell you that this record should be like this.

426
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,290
All right.

427
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:01,160
When you're trying to see what it is, trying to create a record like this here, k8sengineers.com

428
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:02,570
k8sengineers.com

429
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:03,270
Which is wrong.

430
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:04,670
It should be like this.

431
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:07,220
So you say yes, this is good and save.

432
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:10,230
Okay.

433
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:18,150
So the record is created and our ACM service, which is this one, it will try to resolve this name

434
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,730
with this value and that may take a few minutes or sometimes even an hour.

435
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,690
Very rarely takes an hour, but just wait for some time.

436
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:34,950
So you need to just keep checking whether it is pending validation or is it issued.

437
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:40,710
So keep refreshing this in a minute or 5 minutes like that and you should see this ok in some time.

438
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:42,690
So I will wait for a few minutes.

439
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:49,080
Okay, that was like just a minute or so and I get the certificate issued.

440
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:54,660
You should see that if you're not seeing this for a long, long time, still showing pending validation,

441
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:58,080
then delete the certificate created once again.

442
00:24:59,470 --> 00:25:03,810
And again, add the record because mostly it's typographical mistake.

443
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:10,420
And if you think everything is perfect, you verified nothing is wrong, then check with your domain

444
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,880
registrar whether your domain is active or not.

445
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,490
Sometimes you just create a domain and it's not even active.

446
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:17,090
Okay.

447
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,500
So check with, like if I have issue I will check with GoDaddy.

448
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:23,050
I will check with the support that I created this record.

449
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:23,980
It's not working.

450
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,140
And there should be help helping you.

451
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,230
All right.

452
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,190
That was good.

453
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,650
And really good job.

454
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:37,500
We have set AWS account in a very, very practical way.

455
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,630
Oh, one thing is missing.

456
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,140
We have to log in with the IAM user so we will sign out.

457
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:47,900
Okay.

458
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:51,500
I just signed out without getting the URL, so I'm going to log in again.

459
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,610
With my root account.

460
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,050
I'm logging in with the root account.

461
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,060
Okay.

462
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,930
I'm going to refresh this one.

463
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:04,100
I dunno, I have many times problem with this.

464
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:08,330
wrong captcha it says many times.

465
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,280
Okay.

466
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,920
See it's asking MFA code now that's how you're secure.

467
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:20,470
Okay.

468
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:22,000
Let's go to IAM.

469
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:25,970
And you can find the link over here.

470
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:26,720
There you see.

471
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:31,170
Copy that URL and just put it in the browser.

472
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,050
And that's my account name.

473
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:39,830
imnowdevops and I think I have same as my username.

474
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,040
That's a sign in.

475
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:48,670
Oh my bad.

476
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:55,870
I have the username as itadmin that I have created and I downloaded the CSV file which has the password.

477
00:26:55,870 --> 00:26:58,720
Also, I know I'm showing you the password, but this will be reset.

478
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,330
So account name is imnowdevops, username is this.

479
00:27:05,630 --> 00:27:07,070
And that's the password.

480
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,140
And we will see signing.

481
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,250
MFA code.

482
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,400
Okay.

483
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:18,420
Resetting the password, it will ask you to reset the password.

484
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,510
Confirm password change.

485
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,050
Switch to new console.

486
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:31,420
Nice.

487
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,880
Now we are done and you can use this.

488
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:35,760
IAM user.

489
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:38,630
Throughout the course.

490
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,800
Whenever you have a problem, go back to your root user and you can use the root user also.

491
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,480
But I recommend always use this.

492
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,230
IAM user.

493
00:27:46,870 --> 00:27:47,320
All right.

494
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:49,210
That is all in the setup part.

495
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,260
Alright.

496
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,720
So we have installed a lot of tools on our system.

497
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:00,560
We have signed up on multiple accounts and we have made AWS account useful and secure for us.

498
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:02,450
All the tools are installed.

499
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:10,430
We have signed up to these four places, GitHub domain, Docker hub,sonar cloud and we have created

500
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:11,660
AWS free tier account

501
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:18,140
IAM user with the MFA , Billing Alarm and Certificate, so we're going to use all these things throughout

502
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,940
our projects different, different projects.

503
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:24,340
So wrap this up and join me in project videos.

504
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,710
Thank you very much for watching this one.
