00:00:11,112 --> 00:00:14,387
Hello and welcome to the prerequisites session.

2
00:00:14,737 --> 00:00:18,127
In this video we are going to talk about what are

3
00:00:18,145 --> 00:00:21,500
the skills that you need to have in this course.

4
00:00:22,462 --> 00:00:24,667
So in order to follow along in this

5
00:00:24,715 --> 00:00:28,057
course, you need to have some understanding about

6
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,492
Linux systems and intermediate knowledge should be fine.

7
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:35,082
Some basics of scripting knowledge like Bash scripting

8
00:00:35,247 --> 00:00:36,847
or even if you have knowledge of any

9
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,947
other scripting language that is also fine.

10
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:41,482
Some troubleshooting skills you need to have.

11
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:44,557
You get into issues and then you find out what is

12
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,172
the what are the problems and then you fix them, which

13
00:00:48,205 --> 00:00:51,562
will be really based on your previous experience with your job

14
00:00:51,625 --> 00:00:53,987
or with some tools that you have learned.

15
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:56,387
Basics of AWS.

16
00:00:57,262 --> 00:01:00,027
If you have knowledge of EC Two, elastic load,

17
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:03,622
balancer, s, three buckets, this should be enough.

18
00:01:03,805 --> 00:01:05,827
There are so many other services that we are going to

19
00:01:05,845 --> 00:01:09,322
learn in all these projects that we're going to do and

20
00:01:09,355 --> 00:01:12,637
I'm going to explain about those services, how to use them

21
00:01:12,775 --> 00:01:15,662
and how to include them into the projects.

22
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:20,647
Some networking and security concepts like

23
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,077
port numbers, protocols, firewalls and securities.

24
00:01:25,257 --> 00:01:28,267
If you already used AWS EC Two, then

25
00:01:28,315 --> 00:01:30,322
things like security group should be fine.

26
00:01:30,355 --> 00:01:31,462
If you have knowledge and security

27
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,992
group that should be fine.

28
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:35,722
And some basics of virtualization concepts like

29
00:01:35,755 --> 00:01:39,622
virtual machines, virtual storage, virtual networks which

30
00:01:39,655 --> 00:01:41,912
you'd have already used in AWS.

31
00:01:48,812 --> 00:01:51,647
Intermediate understanding of Jenkins or some hands on

32
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,377
experience on Jenkins tool, some hands on experience

33
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,697
on ansible like writing very, very basic, basic

34
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,627
playbooks, having understanding of continuous integration and continuous

35
00:02:01,657 --> 00:02:04,022
delivery and understanding should be fine.

36
00:02:04,205 --> 00:02:06,652
Because we have many projects on continuous integration

37
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:08,520
and continuous delivery, we are going to do

38
00:02:08,555 --> 00:02:11,327
all that, but having a basic knowledge of

39
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:13,812
that will be an added advantage.

40
00:02:14,612 --> 00:02:18,912
Basic knowledge of containers, especially docker,

41
00:02:20,237 --> 00:02:22,487
like installing docker engine and running

42
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,102
some very very basic docker containers.

43
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:28,412
So all these are the predicacides for this course.

44
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,497
The skills that you need to have.

45
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,537
If you feel that you are not so sure

46
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:35,672
about these skills, then you can even join my

47
00:02:35,705 --> 00:02:40,927
decoding DevOps live online course where I cover DevOps

48
00:02:40,957 --> 00:02:43,887
from the very scratch starting from the Linux machines

49
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:47,017
and you will get a deep understanding of Jenkins,

50
00:02:47,077 --> 00:02:52,622
ansible continuous integration, continuous delivery, docker kubernetes and many

51
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:54,225
many AWS services.

52
00:02:54,587 --> 00:02:56,152
That is if you are a total newbie.

53
00:02:56,182 --> 00:02:58,397
But if you don't know any of this tool or any

54
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,652
of this technology that are in the previco sites, then you

55
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:05,297
can either learn them before you start the course or when

56
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:07,337
you get into the course, when you get into a project

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,052
and you feel that you need to know this technology at

58
00:03:10,070 --> 00:03:11,700
that time, also you can learn.

59
00:03:13,412 --> 00:03:14,897
So all the very best and

60
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:17,252
good luck for the upcoming project.

61
00:03:17,345 --> 00:03:18,512
Thank you very much for watching.

62
00:03:18,575 --> 00:03:19,675
I'll see you in the next one.
