1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:02,070
So we'll create an account on GitHub.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,330
We'll talk about purchasing a domain, creating an account on Docker hub, and also creating account

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,320
on sonarcloud.

4
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:17,990
And then after that, we're going to talk about AWS Free tier account and few other changes that

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,850
we're going to make in the AWS  account.

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,880
So let's get started with GitHub first.

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,480
So open your browser.

8
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:27,340
Go to github.com

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,970
It's a simple signup process.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,200
You give a username.

11
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,810
You give the email address, password and say, Sign up.

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:43,100
And from your inbox you confirm that email address and then you should be able to log in to github.com

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,400
.

14
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,810
So fill in your right details and sign up.

15
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:51,740
Okay.

16
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:53,030
I need to do some verification.

17
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,220
Spiral Galaxy.

18
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,440
Okay, that's the Spiral Galaxy maybe.

19
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,020
Yes.

20
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:00,280
Okay.

21
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,690
So account verified there.

22
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:07,030
I don't want any offers on announcements.

23
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,420
I'm going to go for a free plan and that should be fine for our project.

24
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,500
Welcome to GitHub.

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:18,660
So select.

26
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:20,190
What kind of work do you do?

27
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:20,800
Mainly.

28
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,580
So I'm going to see a teacher.

29
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,080
And a student.

30
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:26,960
Oh.

31
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,210
I can select either of it.

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:28,510
Okay.

33
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:29,410
So I shall be.

34
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,220
I'm a teacher.

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,780
Most software engineer.

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:36,460
How much programming experience do you have?

37
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,490
Select whatever you are good at.

38
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:49,080
Who do you plan to use GitHub for learn git and GitHub, host project.

39
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,240
That should be good for now.

40
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,680
And you can see a complete setup.

41
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,870
After this check your inboxes.

42
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,270
Should get an email verified that email address.

43
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:15,670
Okay.

44
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:18,040
So my email is verified.

45
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,720
So that is done.

46
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,730
We have created an account on GitHub.

47
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:25,080
That should be fine for now.

48
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,940
We use it later.

49
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,500
Next we will talk about purchasing a domain.

50
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,110
So if you have never done this, then I'll show this to you.

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,620
Or else if you already know about this, then you can purchase domain from any of the domain registrar.

52
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,920
I will use GoDaddy.

53
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:55,580
So you can search for a domain like, for example, my dev ops projects or see if this domain is available.

54
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:57,350
Yeah.

55
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,740
199 per year for me.

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:07,640
So you can say add to cart and you can sign in if you don't have an account with the domain registrar, Create

57
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,200
an account.

58
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:11,180
purchase a domain and don't go for free domains.

59
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:16,520
There are also free domains, but we'll be doing so many settings in this DNS.

60
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:22,040
So we will need a paid domain where we can go to the advanced settings of DNS.

61
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,360
So whatever you feel like you can purchase, dot com, dot in on whatever domain you want, you give a name,

62
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,290
search for it.

63
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,650
You really don't need to get a very expensive one.

64
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,920
Any domain should be fine.

65
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:36,250
Okay.

66
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,120
Once you made the purchase and then you log in, you should see your domain.

67
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,770
I have groophy.in.

68
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:50,840
And you should see the DNS records you click on DNS service and you will see a few records.

69
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,730
We are going to add a lot of records.

70
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,080
If you know how to use it, you can start using it already.

71
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,380
But if you don't know, don't worry.

72
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,150
We'll be using it in our projects many times.

73
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,380
Okay, so once you have the domain, the next thing will do is create an account on Docker hub.

74
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,300
We just need to create account, that's all.

75
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:13,580
So let's go to Docker Hub.

76
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,740
Search for Docker Hub on the net.

77
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:20,649
You should find Docker Hub site.

78
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,580
Not that that's the wrong one.

79
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,670
Docker hub, hub.docker.com

80
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:32,030
Okay.

81
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,050
So we'll sign up.

82
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
So give some ID.

83
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,730
like a username kubeimran.

84
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:42,360
I'm giving.

85
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:47,020
And give your email address and password and say sign up.

86
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,030
I'm not a robot.

87
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,050
Sign up.

88
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,260
You need to choose a plan.

89
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:55,770
You can go with the free plan.

90
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:56,690
That should be fine.

91
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:01,400
Verifying your email address, so I should get an email.

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,310
And let me refresh it once again.

93
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:18,170
So we created an account on Docker hub.

94
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,450
And that's all for now.

95
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:21,260
On Docker Hub.

96
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:24,740
We are going to store Docker images on this in the Docker projects.

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:27,220
Ok last thing

98
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,840
In the sign up, we have sonar cloud.

99
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,820
Let's log into the sooner cloud.

100
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,910
sonarcloud.io.

101
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:38,750
.

102
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,380
Click on it.

103
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:48,650
And you can sign up with your GitHub account or Bitbucket azure DevOps or GitLab account. We will sign

104
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:49,670
up with GitHub account.

105
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,920
So as the authorized allowed, I have already signed into my GitHub account from the same browser.

106
00:05:58,370 --> 00:06:00,890
So I'm getting this or else you will get a log in.

107
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:02,770
window where you

108
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,100
can use your username and password of GitHub account.

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,460
We will click on this, create projects manually.

110
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:24,190
Then you can import all of the things from GitHub, but we really don't have anything on GitHub.

111
00:06:24,190 --> 00:06:29,080
So I'm going to create organization manually, so let's give a name.

112
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:33,250
So for the time being, I'm giving vprofile-projects.

113
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,410
vprofile-projects.

114
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,560
Now that has to be unique.

115
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,210
So you give your own name.

116
00:06:42,910 --> 00:06:46,510
Every plan should be fine for us and we see clear organization.

117
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,000
So that's our organization name.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,720
vprofile-projects,

119
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:54,560
You create your own name and a project key.

120
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:59,060
I'd say vpro-analysis.

121
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,440
Any project name you can give.

122
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:02,680
And say set up.

123
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,220
That is all this much is fine when we see when we use it into our AWS project.

124
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,600
AWS CICD project.

125
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:18,060
There you need to mention this organization name and project name so you can take a note or any time

126
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:21,270
you can log in and find out your organization name and your project name.

127
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:22,740
All right, then.

128
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,450
That should be all in.

129
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,020
Sign up.

130
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:31,420
So we are doing good, we have GitHub account now we have a domain, we have created an account on Docker hub

131
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:36,550
and we have a sonar cloud account and we have configured the organisation and project in sonar cloud.
