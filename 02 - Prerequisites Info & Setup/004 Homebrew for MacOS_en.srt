00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:01,374
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:01,472 --> 00:00:03,270
In this video, we will see

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,870
how to install Homebrew on macOS.

4
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:11,730
Homebrew is a tool to install softwares or packages.

5
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,202
We will be installing some software or tools in the

6
00:00:17,216 --> 00:00:21,370
next lecture, and we will be using Homebrew on macOS.

7
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,826
So let's search for Homebrew.

8
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,474
So open your browser, search for Homebrew, and

9
00:00:27,512 --> 00:00:30,140
click on the first link, brew sh.

10
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,994
There you see a link or the command.

11
00:00:38,102 --> 00:00:40,130
You just need to copy this command

12
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:42,254
and run this command on the terminal.

13
00:00:42,302 --> 00:00:44,050
So let's open the terminal.

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:51,962
All right, let's paste the command on

15
00:00:51,976 --> 00:00:54,820
the terminal command v, hit Enter.

16
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:56,390
Enter.

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:01,520
The password hit Enter.

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:08,770
After the installation, you will see two commands.

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:11,170
I'm going to pace those commands.

20
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,478
This one.

21
00:01:12,624 --> 00:01:15,674
Now, you don't see this after the installation

22
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:17,950
here, because I have already installed Brew.

23
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,718
But you will see this command.

24
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:22,238
You can copy and paste this in the terminal.

25
00:01:22,394 --> 00:01:23,714
That's one command.

26
00:01:23,882 --> 00:01:25,200
And the next one.

27
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:30,854
After running these two commands, you

28
00:01:30,892 --> 00:01:33,222
can start using Brew command.

29
00:01:33,306 --> 00:01:34,754
So if you just type Brew and hit

30
00:01:34,792 --> 00:01:38,260
Enter, you should see some output like this.

31
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,878
Now, by using Brew command, you can install

32
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,750
software so you can search for your software.

33
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:48,954
We will be installing a tool called Maven.

34
00:01:49,122 --> 00:01:54,038
So let's search for Maven, and you get

35
00:01:54,064 --> 00:01:56,154
the command of how to install Maven.

36
00:01:56,202 --> 00:01:57,878
So just copy this and run it in

37
00:01:57,904 --> 00:02:00,342
your terminal, and Maven will get installed.

38
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:01,478
That's one example.

39
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:02,678
Like that, you can search for

40
00:02:02,704 --> 00:02:04,974
any software, for example, JDK.

41
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:07,602
Or you can search for, let's

42
00:02:07,626 --> 00:02:10,419
say, vagrant, which we'll be using.

43
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:13,914
So you get the command, find your software,

44
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,410
copy the command, run it in the terminal,

45
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,070
and the software will get installed.

46
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:21,206
So that is all in this video.

47
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:22,514
I will see you in the next one,

48
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:25,182
where we'll install softwares by using brew.

49
00:02:25,326 --> 00:02:27,090
See you in the next one. Bye.
