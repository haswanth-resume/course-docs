00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:11,760
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,350
In this video, we will be talking about tools and technologies, prerequisites.

3
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,970
Before you dive into the project videos, you need to set a few things first.

4
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,800
So there will be so many technologies working together in the upcoming project videos.

5
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:28,830
We need to get ready for that.

6
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:37,510
Starting with GitHub repository, where we have kept all the code scripts and files which you need in

7
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:38,140
this course.

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,480
So let's see that first.

9
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:52,320
So open up your browser and you can see GitHub dot com slash dev ops equity club slash view profile

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:52,950
project.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,030
Hey enter.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,690
You should bookmark this link will be using this throughout our course.

13
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:07,440
In the GitHub repository that we have, you have several branches and based on which project you are,

14
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,360
you will select that particular branch.

15
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,100
I will let you know in the project that which branch will be using for a particular project.

16
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,470
Like for example, if you are doing continuous delivery with Jenkins and Ansible together, then we'll

17
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:20,730
be selecting this branch.

18
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,010
Or if you're doing a cloud formation, you'll be going to cloud formation branch.

19
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,610
If you're doing Kubernetes, you'll be going to Kubernetes branch.

20
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:36,700
For Kubernetes itself, you have three different branches cube CD, Cube app, and Kubernetes setup.

21
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,390
So likewise we have several other branches.

22
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:44,740
Based on the project, I'll tell you which branch you should be using in the project.

23
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,320
If you want, you can clone this for now.

24
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,710
But I will tell you in a few minutes what tool will be using to access this repository.

25
00:01:54,160 --> 00:02:02,110
So whenever I use the word as source code or repository, I mean to see this GitHub repository.

26
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:03,400
Okay.

27
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,760
Now let's check the other tools and signups that we need to do.

28
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,260
We will be working in three areas in these videos, the tools that we need to install on a laptop or

29
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,860
desktop.

30
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:21,480
Second, the sign ups that we need to do on some accounts.

31
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,410
And third, some e w s prerequisites that we be doing.

32
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,670
So let's get start with the tool, lets see the tools that we will be installing.

33
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,250
We need Oracle VM VirtualBox Git Bash Vagrant.

34
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:42,450
And chocolate if you're using Windows System or you can install BRU if you're using macros.

35
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:47,330
Also we need a few more tools.

36
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:55,460
JDK eight Maven Intel e.g. which will be your ID if you prefer to use something else like Visual Studio,

37
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,310
or if you have any other personal preference you can go with.

38
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:00,770
That will be also using Sublime Text Editor.

39
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:09,200
Also A.W. Seelye And there are a few tools like, for example, TerraForm that will be setting up in

40
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,220
the project itself.

41
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,160
Few places you need to sign up like GitHub.

42
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,290
You also need to purchase a domain.

43
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:21,380
I will be using GoDaddy platform for that.

44
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:27,770
If you have any personal preference in that, then you can use any other domain registrar account also

45
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,570
on Docker Hub to store our Docker images and also sorts near cloud.

46
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,450
On edibles.

47
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,800
We need to do a few things.

48
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:40,050
We need to force to get a free diet account.

49
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:41,810
Ruleset set one.

50
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:44,540
I am user with multi-factor authentication.

51
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,980
We'll set a billing alarm and will also get a certificate from a WSP, which we will be using in setting

52
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,800
up H2 DPS.

53
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,050
Secure Connection.

54
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,970
So let's get started with the tools first.
