00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:05,190
Okay, so now we have a very easy way of installing software on our computer.

2
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:11,700
So I will show you the list of tools that you have to install based on your operating system.

3
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:16,650
Windows user and macOS user will execute the respective commands.

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,860
So in our repository, in our source code, access the branch prereqs

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:27,440
In this branch there is a PDF.

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,270
You can open it here itself.

7
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:36,470
So for Windows installing tools on Windows, once you have set up the chocolatey, now you can install

8
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:45,530
all these tools, choco install virtualbox and vagrant, git, JDK8, maven, awscli, Intellij and

9
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:49,010
Sublime Text Editor. For macOS User.

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:56,480
Same tools, but you have homebrew to install the software and before you start installing the software,

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,980
you have to do this.

12
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:05,780
You open your terminal, execute this command exactly as it is, and then check with cat command.

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,560
and this file should contain the letter hyphen -k.

14
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:18,070
And it should be without any quotes, any double qoute or single qoute if you find it is not correct.

15
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,970
Open that file.

16
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:21,860
It will be in your home directory.

17
00:01:22,190 --> 00:01:30,110
Make sure this file has hyphen -k option, save it, and then start installing your software's same software

18
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:31,730
but with brew command.

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,520
If you are having mac OS with M1 chip, then you do not need to install virtualbox.

20
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,550
The first command you need to skip.

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,530
And you execute all the rest of the commands on your terminal, which will install these softwares except

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,730
VirtualBox.

23
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:58,010
But if you have Mac OS with intel chip, then install virtualbox execute all the commands.

24
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:07,190
VirtualBox on M1 chip is not supported and we will be installing its replacement, its alternative which

25
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,360
is VMware.

26
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:10,280
That will be in lecture 19.

27
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,930
So I will be using a choco command.

28
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,100
And installing these tools.

29
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,650
So I will open PowerShell as administrator, macOS user.

30
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:24,520
You need to just open your terminal.

31
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:29,320
I will be executing these commands one by one. Simultaneously

32
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:39,420
MacOS user, You need to execute the brew install command ,one by one. Except for M1  and M2 chip,

33
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,770
The first command is excluded.

34
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,390
Also observe.

35
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,790
I have specified a version over here.

36
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:56,100
The latest version of VirtualBox is not working with us, or I should say not working with vagrant and

37
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,270
we are having a lot of issues.

38
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,310
So we tested.

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,180
This is the version that we will be using for now.

40
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:08,520
Later, whatever version you see in this document, you may see some version for Vagrant, you may see

41
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,720
some version for Git.

42
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:15,180
So make sure whatever version you see in the document, you execute that same command.

43
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:20,250
So right now in the document, if you see this version specified, then execute that version.

44
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,570
Okay, let's download this file so we can copy paste command easily.

45
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,860
Let's click on download.

46
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,730
Let's open that file.

47
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,630
So now we can copy this.

48
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,490
you see that?

49
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:35,690
Copy that.

50
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,700
Let's open PowerShell.

51
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,270
So I'm going to say PowerShell on my search.

52
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,270
And I have different versions of PowerShell, so you see different versions here.

53
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,700
So just right click on it and say run as administrator only as administrator, not as normal user.

54
00:03:53,700 --> 00:04:00,060
You should see here administrator Windows PowerShell like this, if you don't see it, close it again,

55
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:07,200
open as administrator, right click and as soon as I right click it copies the command, it starts installing

56
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,090
and is asking me a question.

57
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:13,710
I will say Capital A to accept all the questions you ask.

58
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,480
So it's going to take a moment, download and install.

59
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:20,519
Let's go to the next command.

60
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,440
choco install vagrant

61
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:29,080
I'm going to install all these commands one by one on my PowerShell.

62
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,090
And once I'm done executing all these commands, I'll finally reboot my machine.

63
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,760
I'm done with VirtualBox.

64
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,890
I'm going to install now Vagrant.

65
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,850
Alright, so I have installed all my tools.

66
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:14,800
I got a small error while I'm installing sublime text.

67
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,840
But anyways, it's working fine.

68
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,680
If you are not able to install any of this tool through chocolatey, then you can also find it from the

69
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,270
internet, download and install it.

70
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,490
Like for example, sublime text editor.

71
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,500
But anyway, Sublime Text editor is installed.

72
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,030
Sublime Text three.

73
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,570
So it's not a problem.

74
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,850
Now, once you're done installing all the tools you need to reboot your machine, the reboot is specifically

75
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:53,840
for Vagrant.

76
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,220
So if you're done installing all the tools, reboot the machine and continue when you are done.

77
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,740
Okay, so now you should have all these tools installed.

78
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:18,430
Oracle VirtualBox, GitBash, Vagrant, Chocolatey or homebrew based on your operating system.

79
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,900
JDK8, Maven Intellij and Sublime Text Editor.

80
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,820
If you have these tools now ready, then we can get on to the next thing, which is signing up a few

81
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
accounts.
