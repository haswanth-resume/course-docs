1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:05,100
The first tool that we'll be installing is chocolaty.

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:14,320
chocolaty is a tool in Windows to install software through command line like choice install notepad++.

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,140
That will be the command to install notepad++.

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,360
And this is not a mandatory tool.

5
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,990
You can just search for software on the Internet and download and install also.

6
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:28,160
But this is just to make your life easy.

7
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:34,820
So you open PowerShell or command prompt and run the command and install the software.

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,630
If you do not want to install chocolaty you are having trouble installing chocolate then you can.

9
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:41,950
even skip this part.

10
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:45,550
Then you have to install all the softwares that I show you.

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:48,520
Manually, search on the internet, download and install.

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,450
So just search for chocolatey.

13
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,070
This is for windows.

14
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,560
If you're using mac os, then I have another tool for you which is homebrew that I'll show you in a

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:00:59,890
minute.

16
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,130
So chocolatey will be our tool to install all the other tools.

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:08,650
And first we need to install chocolatey.

18
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,450
And for that, this is the command.

19
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:14,350
And we're going to run this command on PowerShell.

20
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:17,790
When we run this command in PowerShell, it will install Chocolaty.

21
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,460
And then we can use chocolate install command to install all the other tools.

22
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:23,920
So let me open PowerShell first.

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:27,340
You have to open PowerShell as administrator.

24
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,670
So right click and run as administrator.

25
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,960
We need to run a few commands to check.

26
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,740
If we can install chocolatey, you have to run this get execution policy.

27
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:43,220
command.

28
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,640
If this returns restricted, then we have to run this command.

29
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:00,490
So it reads All signed for me.

30
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:04,090
But if you received restricted, then you better run this.

31
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:04,540
command.

32
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,410
Just say yes to it and then you should be able to install chocolatey. So copy this command,

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:15,520
once you're done, open your PowerShell.

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,500
Paste this command if you should just right click.

35
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,420
It should paste. Hit enter.

36
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:28,320
If you get error like this, that means your antivirus maybe blocking the software to be installed.

37
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:33,830
I have McAfee and I'm going to disable it.

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,340
For 15 minutes.

39
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,390
But now you have to close PowerShell and open it once again.

40
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,570
Let's copy the command.

41
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,180
And let's run it.

42
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:56,110
Let's hit.

43
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,470
Enter.

44
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:01,200
And now it started installing Chocolaty.

45
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,520
Once you have chocolatey installed, then you can search for any software in this website.

46
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,650
If you want to install VirtualBox or we can just search for VirtualBox and it will give us the command.

47
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:17,820
I see.

48
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:18,690
I understand.

49
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,140
So if you give us the command to install VirtualBox.

50
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,390
So you can just go install VirtualBox.

51
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,020
It will install VirtualBox or any of the software that you are looking for.

52
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,940
Like IntelliJ

53
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:36,280
Okay.

54
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,160
So you get the commands and then you can install your tools.

55
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:45,280
That was a convenient tool for Windows user.
